<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>This book is the outcome of a course of lectures delivered
by me in successive years to Latin Honours students in
accordance with the regulations of the University of Wales. It
is therefore primarily intended for the assistance of classical
students; but it may perhaps appeal in its present form to a
somewhat wider circle.</p>

<p>At the time that the book was begun the best systematic
exposition of the Stoic philosophy available for English readers
was to be found in Prof. <span class="smcap">E. Zeller’s</span> <i>Stoics Epicureans and
Sceptics</i>, translated by <span class="smcap">O. J. Reichel</span> (Longmans, 1892). This
work, admirable in detail, is nevertheless somewhat inadequate
to the subject, which appeared to its learned author as a mere
sequel to the much more important philosophical systems of
Plato and Aristotle. Since its first appearance many qualified
writers have been inclined to assign a higher rank to Stoicism,
amongst whom <span class="smcap">L. Stein</span>, <span class="smcap">A. Schmekel</span>, and <span class="smcap">Hans</span> von
<span class="smcap">Arnim</span> in the German-speaking countries, and <span class="smcap">A. C. Pearson</span>,
<span class="smcap">G. H. Rendall</span>, and <span class="smcap">R. D. Hicks</span> in our own, are perhaps
most conspicuous.</p>

<p>The view taken in this book corresponds generally to that
taken by the writers named. Shortly expressed, it regards
Stoicism as the bridge between ancient and modern philosophical
thought; a position which appears to be accepted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
<span class="smcap">W. L. Davidson</span> writing on behalf of students of modern
philosophy. Mr Hicks and Mr Davidson have recently published
works dealing with the Stoic philosophy as a whole; but as
neither of these quite covers the ground marked out for this
book, I believe that room will be found for a further presentation
of the subject.</p>

<p>To the writers named and to many others, my obligations
are great, and their extent is generally indicated in the Index.
I owe a more intimate debt to Mr <span class="smcap">A. C. Pearson</span> and
Prof. <span class="smcap">Alfred Caldecott</span>, who have given me ungrudgingly
of their knowledge and counsel during the whole period of the
preparation of this book.</p>

<p>The appearance of H. von Arnim’s ‘Stoicorum veterum
fragmenta’ made available to me a mass of material from
Greek sources, and has (I hope) made this book less imperfect
on the side of Greek than it would otherwise have been. For
the quotations in the notes from the Greek and the less-known
Latin authors I have generally given references to von Arnim’s
collections, which will doubtless be more accessible to most of
my readers than the original writers. These references include
those to the fragments of Zeno and Cleanthes, for which
von Arnim is in the main indebted to the earlier work of
Pearson.</p>

<p>So general a treatment of the subject as is here presented
must necessarily leave room for correction and amplification
in its various branches, and I trust that I am pointing out to
younger students a field in which a rich harvest may yet be
gleaned. To such students the appended Bibliography, though
necessarily incomplete, may be of use as an introduction to the
considerable literature which is available to them.</p>

<p>The concluding chapter makes its appeal not so much to
classical students, as such, as to those who are interested in
the problem of Christian origins; the further problems of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
influence of Stoicism on modern literature and philosophy,
though at first included in my programme, I have not ventured
to enter upon. But I hope that at least I have been able to
show that the interest of classical studies, even as regards
Hellenistic philosophy, does not lie wholly in the past.</p>

<p>My sincere thanks are due to the Council of the University
College of North Wales for granting me special assistance in
my College duties during the Spring term of 1910, in order
that I might give more time to this book; to the Syndics of
the Cambridge University Press for undertaking its publication;
and to Mr Clay and his expert staff for the admirable execution
of the printing.</p>

<p>In the text the accentuation of Greek words should be corrected as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a href="#Page_117">P. 117</a>, l. 10, χρεῖαι. <a href="#Page_239">P. 239</a>, l. 6, μέρων. <a href="#Page_423">P. 423</a>, l. 16, ἀγάπη.</p>

<p class="transnote">(Transcriber’s Note: These have been corrected.)</p>

<p>For the quotations in the notes from Greek writers, more precise references
will usually be found in the sections named of von Arnim’s <i>Stoicorum
veterum fragmenta</i>. In addition the following amplifications or corrections
are needed:</p>

<p id="section1"><b>1.</b> The present work treats of a subject of outstanding
interest in the literature which is associated with
the history of the Roman State, and which is
expressed partly in Hellenistic Greek, partly in Latin. In the
generations preceding our own, classical study has, to a large
extent, attended to form rather than to matter, to expression
rather than to content. To-day it is beginning to take a wider
outlook. We are learning to look on literature as an unveiling
of the human mind in its various stages of development, and as
a key to the true meaning of history. The literature of Greece
proper does not cease to attract us by its originality, charm, and
variety; but the new interest may yet find its fullest satisfaction
in Roman literature; for of all ancient peoples the Romans
achieved most, and their achievements have been the most
enduring. It was the Roman who joined the ends of the world
by his roads and his bridges, poured into crowded towns unfailing
supplies of corn and perennial streams of pure water, cleared
the countryside of highwaymen, converted enemies into neighbours,
created ideals of brotherhood under which the nations
were united by common laws and unfettered marriage relations,
and so shaped a new religion that if it shattered an empire it
yet became the mother of many nations. We are the inheritors
of Roman civilization; and if we have far surpassed it in
scientific knowledge and material plenty, we are not equally
confident that we possess better mental balance, or more complete
social harmony. In this direction the problems of Roman
life are the problems of Western life to-day; and the methods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
by which they were approached in the Roman world deserve
more than ever to be studied by us. Such a study, if it is to be
in any true sense historical, must break through the convention
by which ancient Greece and Rome have come to be treated as
a world apart; it must seek its starting point in the distant past,
and count that of chief importance which will bear fruit in the
ages that follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beliefs of the Romans.</div>

<p id="section2"><b>2.</b> Great achievements are born of strong convictions; and
Roman statesmen, jurists, soldiers, and engineers
did not learn to ‘scorn delights and live laborious
days’ without some strong impulse from within. These inner
convictions do not come to the surface everywhere in the Latin
literature with which we are most familiar. The Roman orator
or poet is generally content to express a conventional view of
religion and morals, whilst he conceals his real thoughts in a
spirit of reticence and almost of shame. Yet here and there
every attentive reader will catch the accent of sincerity, sometimes
in the less restrained conversation of the lower classes,
sometimes in flights of poetic imagination, or again in instruction
designed for the young. In this way we learn that the Romans
of the last century of the republic and of the first century of the
principate were profoundly concerned, not so much with questions
connected with the safety of their empire or the justice
of their form of government, as with problems in which all
mankind has a common interest. What is truth, and how can
it be ascertained? What is this universe in which we dwell,
and by whom and how was it made? What are the beings
called gods, and do they concern themselves with the affairs of
men? What is man’s nature, his duty, and his destiny? These
the Romans called the problems of philosophy, and they eagerly
sought for definite and practical solutions to them<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Such
solutions when embodied in theoretical systems we still call
‘philosophies’; but when such systems are developed in a
practical form and claim the obedience of large bodies of men
they become religions. Stoicism is in the first instance a
philosophy, and amongst its many competitors that one which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
appealed most successfully to the judgment of men who played
a leading part in the Roman world; but as its acceptance
becomes more general, it begins to assume all the features of a
religion. All Latin literature is thickly strewn with allusions to
Stoicism and the systems which were its rivals, and thus bears
witness to the widespread interest which they excited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of Philosophy.</div>

<p id="section3"><b>3.</b> The Romans learnt philosophy from Greek teachers;
and they were not free from a sense of shame in
thus sitting at the feet of the children of a
conquered race. But they acknowledged their obligations in
a generous spirit; and from Roman literature an impression has
arisen, which is still widespread, that Greece was the birthplace
of philosophy, and that its triumphs must be placed to the credit
of Hellenic culture. But to the Hellenes themselves philosophy
equally appeared as a foreign fashion, assailing their national
beliefs and dangerous to their established morality; and of its
teachers many of the most distinguished were immigrants from
Asia Minor. Thus Greece itself appears only as a halting-place
in the movement of philosophy; and we are carried more and
more to the East as we seek to discover its origin. Yet at the
time with which we are concerned it had also spread to the
extreme West. ‘The Magi,’ says Aristotle, ‘taught the Persians
philosophy; the Chaldaeans taught it to the Babylonians and
Assyrians; the Gymnosophists to the Indians; the Druids
and Semnothei to the Gauls and Celts<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.’ It was a world-wide
stirring of the human intellect, and we must attempt to outline
its meaning more completely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">National and World-Religions.</div>

<p id="section4"><b>4.</b> Philosophy, in the sense in which Aristotle uses the
term, appears to be a general name for a great
change in man’s intellectual attitude towards his
environment, corresponding to a definite era in the
history of civilization. Before philosophy came nationalism, the
habit of thinking according to clan and race; and nationalism
remains on record for us in the numerous national religions in
which each people does reverence to the deity which lives within
its borders and goes forth to fight with its armies. Philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
is at once broader in its outlook and more intimate in its appeal.
It breaks down the barriers of race, and includes the whole world
in its survey; but on the other hand it justifies the individual in
asserting his own thoughts and choosing his own way of life.
Thus philosophy on its arrival appears in each particular country
as a disintegrating force; it strikes at the roots of patriotism and
piety, and challenges equally the authority of king and of priest.
But everywhere in turn philosophy, as it gains ground, begins to
construct a new patriotism and a new piety, and gradually takes
concrete shape as a new religion. To us, as we look backwards
to the past, the track of philosophy is recorded by a series of
religions, all alike marked with the note of world-wide outlook,
reverence for reason, and the sentiment of human sympathy.
The era of philosophy is the era of the world-religions. It
belongs to that millennium when from China to Ireland men
of good will and bold spirit realized that they all looked up
toward one sky, breathed one air, and travelled on one all-encircling
sea; when they dreamed that before long all men
should be united in one kingdom, converse in one language, and
obey the one unchanging law of reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of the World-Religions.</div>

<p id="section5"><b>5.</b> The general importance and direction of this movement
will best be seen if we select for consideration a
certain number of the world-religions in which it
was from time to time embodied. Aristotle has
already called our attention to the ‘philosophies’ of the
Chaldaeans, the Persians, and the Indians; amongst these
last Buddhism at least was a movement which had shaken
off limitations of race and class. To these he has added
the Druids, whom we may well keep in mind if only because
they are representatives of Western Europe. Stoicism best
represents the part played by the Greco-Roman world, and
Judaism and Christianity come under consideration as forces
with which Stoicism in the course of its history came into close
contact. The Greeks little realized that they were being carried
along in so mighty a stream. Regarding themselves as isolated
and elevated, the sole pioneers of civilization in a ‘barbarian’
world, the beliefs of neighbouring peoples seemed to them
beneath their notice. To this prejudice they clung in spite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
of the protests of their own men of learning<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the Romans
inherited it from them; and though the Europe of the Middle
Ages and of to-day professes an Oriental faith, its religious
survey is still limited and its critical power impaired by the
same assumption of superior wisdom. Our information is however
wider than that of the ancient world, and our sympathies
are beginning to be quickened; and we are thus in a position
to trace generally the history of these seven religions. In this
work we shall use, as far as possible, the classical authorities,
supplementing them (where deficient) from other sources.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chaldaism.</div>

<p id="section6"><b>6.</b> The oldest of these philosophical or religious systems is
that of the Chaldaeans, as the Romans termed a
pastoral, star-gazing folk<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> presumably identical
with the people which, in or about the year 2800 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, mapped
out the constellations as we now know them, traced the orbits
of the planets<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, and predicted their future movements. This
work was not carried out entirely in the spirit of modern science;
it was further stimulated by the belief that the skies displayed
a written message to mankind. But the nature of that message,
of which fragments are possibly embodied in the names of the
constellations, was not preserved to the Romans by any tradition.
Two principles seem to have survived, those of the inexorable
tie between cause and effect called ‘fate<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>,’ and of the interdependence
of events in heaven and on earth<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Hence arose
the hope of prophetic insight into the future; and the people
of Babylon, under Chaldaean influence, are said to have spent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
four hundred and seventy years in collecting observations of
the history of boys born under particular combinations of the
heavenly bodies<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. We are not acquainted with the results of
these observations; but undoubtedly they established a profession
of astrologers, whose craft it was to observe the position of sun,
moon and stars at a man’s birth or at some other critical hour,
and thence to deduce his future character or career. These
wanderers, called by the Romans ‘Chaldaei’ or ‘Mathematici,’
spread over all Europe, and founded a lucrative trade on men’s
fears and ambitions. Philosophers studied their methods, and
did not always entirely deny their validity<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. In society the
astrologer is a common figure<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; he found his way to the
chambers of princes<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, and was regularly consulted by conspirators.
The dramatic scene in Walter Scott’s <i>Betrothed</i> is
as true in character to Roman times as to the Middle Ages.
Roman literature is full of allusions to the horoscope<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. But
whether we attribute these practices to fraud or to self-deception,
there is every reason to believe that they only form a diseased
outgrowth from a system which at an earlier time was of much
wider import.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persism.</div>

<p id="section7"><b>7.</b> The popular expression ‘magic’ still recalls to us the
system of which the Magi of Persia were the professed
exponents, and of which the Romans had a
knowledge which is to a large extent confirmed from other
sources. This system we shall here call ‘Persism,’ in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
free ourselves of the popular associations still connected with
such terms as Magism, Parsee-ism, and so forth; meaning by
‘Persism’ the teaching of Zarathustra (the Latin Zoroastres) as
it affected the Greek and Latin world. Persism has its roots in
the older nationalism, inasmuch as its deity is one who takes
sides with his believer and brings him victory in war; but on
the other hand it grows into a world-religion because that which
begins as a conflict between races gradually changes into a
struggle between right and wrong. It is based also on the
Chaldaean system, in so far as it looks up to the heaven as the
object of human reverence and to the sun, moon and planets as
at least the symbols of human destiny; but here again the outlook
is transformed, for in the place of impersonal and inexorable
forces we find a company of celestial beings, intimately concerned
in the affairs of men, and engaged in an ardent struggle for the
victory of the better side. The meaning of Persism and its
immense influence on the Greco-Roman world are still so little
realized that it is necessary here to deal with the subject with
some fulness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zarathustra.</div>

<p id="section8"><b>8.</b> The Greeks and Romans refer to the teachings of
Zarathustra as of immemorial antiquity<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; whilst
on the other hand the direct Persian tradition
(existing in a written form from about the year 800 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>)
ascribes them to a date 258 years before the era of Alexander’s
invasion of Persia<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The best modern authorities incline to
the Persian view, thus giving the date of about 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to
Zarathustra, and making him roughly a contemporary of the
Buddha and Confucius<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. On the other hand considerations,
partly of the general history of religion, partly of the linguistic
and metrical character of such fragments of Zarathustra’s
writings as still remain, indicate a date earlier than this by
many hundred years<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Zarathustra belonged to the tribe of
the Magi, who maintained religious practices of which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
nature can only be inferred from such of them as survived the
prophet’s reforms<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; in their general character they cannot have
differed widely from those recorded in the Rigveda. In the
midst of this system Zarathustra came forward as a reformer.
He was deeply learned in the doctrines of the Chaldaeans<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, and
was an ardent student of astronomy<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. In a period of solitary
contemplation in the desert<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, it was revealed to him that a great
and wise being, named Ahura Mazdā, was the creator and ruler
of heaven and earth<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Upon him attend Angels who do him
service; whilst the spirit of Mischief and his attendants ceaselessly
work to oppose his purposes. Ahura is the light, his
enemy is the darkness<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. The struggle between them is that
between right and wrong, and in it every man must take one or
the other side. His soul will survive what men call death, and
receive an everlasting reward according to his deeds. After
quitting the mortal body, the soul will pass over the Bridge
of Judgment, and will there be turned aside to the right or to
the left; if it has been virtuous, to enter Paradise, but if vicious,
the House of Falsehood. Full of this doctrine, Zarathustra
enters the court of King Vishtāspa, and converts him and his
court. The monarch in turn sets out to convert the unbelieving
world by the sword, and the War of Religion begins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of Persism.</div>

<p id="section9"><b>9.</b> We cannot trace the long history of the War of Religion
through its whole course, but in the end we find
that the Religion has welded together the great
kingdom of Persia, and its warlike zeal is directed towards
establishing throughout the world the worship of the ‘God of
heaven,’ and the destruction of all images, whether in the shape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of men or of beasts, as dishonouring to the divine nature. In
the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Babylon opposed the Religion in the east,
and Lydia in the west; both fell before Cyrus the Great. The
fall of Babylon set free the Jews, who accepted the king’s
commission to establish the Religion in Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, and (at a
rather later date) in Egypt<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>; on the other hand that of Lydia
exposed the Hellenes, a people devoted to idol-worship, to the
fury of the image-breakers<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. The battles of Marathon and
Salamis checked the warlike advance of Persism, and the
victories of Alexander suppressed its outward observance and
destroyed its literature and its priesthood. But in this period
of apparent depression some at least of its doctrines were
winning still wider acceptance than before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persism invades Greece.</div>

<p id="section10"><b>10.</b> The departure of the Persians from Europe was the
signal for an outburst of enthusiasm in Greece for
the old gods and their worship with the aid of
images. Yet, unfavourable as the time might seem, a monotheistic
sentiment developed apace in Hellas, which we shall
follow more closely in the next chapter<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Even Herodotus,
writing as a fair-minded historian, no longer regards the Persians
as impious, but realizes that they are actuated by conviction<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Socrates was an outspoken defender of all the main articles of
the Religion, to the horror of nationalists like Aristophanes,
who not unjustly accused him of corrupting the loyalty of the
youth of Athens to the institutions of their mother city.
Xenophon, the most intimate of his disciples, translated this
bias into action, and joined with the 10,000 Greeks in a vain
effort to re-establish the strength of Persia: he did not even
hesitate to engage in war against his native land. To him
Cyrus the Persian was a greater hero than any Homeric warrior
or Greek sage; and from Cyrus he drew the belief in the immortality
of the soul which from this time on is one of the chief
subjects of philosophic speculation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persism welcomed in Rome.</div>

<p id="section11"><b>11.</b> The Romans had not the same national motives as the
Greeks to feel an antipathy to Persism. For the
doctrine of monotheism they had probably been
prepared by their Etruscan sovereigns, and the
temple of Capitoline Jove kept before their eyes a symbol of
this sentiment. But in the Roman period Persian sovereignty
had receded to the far distance, and the doctrines of Persism
only reached Rome through the Greek language and in Greek
form. Thus of the doctrines of the Evil Spirit, the war between
Good and Evil, and the future punishment of the wicked, only
faint echoes ever reached the Roman ear. On the other hand
the doctrines of the divine government of the world and of the
immortality of the soul made a deep impression; and Cicero
in a well-known passage repeats and amplifies the account
Xenophon gives in his <i>Cyropaedia</i> of the dying words of Cyrus,
which is doubtless to some extent coloured by recollections of
the death of Socrates:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘We read in Xenophon that Cyrus the elder on his death-bed spoke as
follows—“Do not think, my very dear children, that when I quit you I shall
no longer be in existence. So long as I was with you, you never saw my
soul, but you realized from my actions that it dwelt in this my body.
Believe then that it will still exist, even if you see nothing of it. Honours
would not continue to be paid to great men after death, did not their souls
assist us to maintain their memory in freshness. I have never been able to
persuade myself that souls live whilst they are enclosed in mortal bodies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
and die when they issue from them; nor that the soul becomes dull at the
moment it leaves this dull body; I believe that when it has freed itself from
all contact with the body and has begun to exist in purity and perfection,
then it becomes wise. Further, when the framework of humanity is broken
up in death, we see clearly whither each of its parts speeds away, for all go
to the elements from which they have sprung; the soul alone is not seen
by us either whilst it is with us or when it departs. Lastly nothing
resembles death so closely as sleep. But men’s souls, whilst they themselves
sleep, most clearly reveal their divine nature; for then, being set free
from their prison house, they often foresee things to come. From this we may
gather what their properties will be, when they have utterly freed themselves
from the fetters of the body. If then this is so, do reverence to me as a
god; but if the soul is destined to perish with the body, still do reverence to
the gods, who guard and rule all this beauteous world, and while so doing
keep up the memory of me in loyal and unalterable affection.” So spoke
Cyrus on his death-bed<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The manifold deity.</div>

<p id="section12"><b>12.</b> The Persian doctrine of the ‘Angels’ seems to have
been very little understood either in Greece or at
Rome, but, as we shall see in the course of this
book, it profoundly influenced the course of religious history.
The ‘Angels’ or good Spirits of Persism are, from one point
of view, identical with the Creator himself, forms under which
he manifests himself to men. Their names are all those
of abstractions: the Good Mind, the Best Reason, the Desired
Kingdom, Holy Humility, Salvation, and Immortality<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. On
the other hand, they gradually assume to the worshipper who
contemplates them the appearance of separate personalities,
dwelling, like the Creator himself, in an atmosphere of heavenly
Glory. Thus a system which is in principle strictly monotheistic
gradually developes into one in which the deity is
sevenfold, as in the following hymn from the later part of the
Avesta:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">‘We praise the heavenly Glory.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">High above the other creatures.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>

    <div class="verse indent0">That live for ever, and work justice.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent4">The All-wise, the Creator<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of these ‘Angels’ one was destined to play a considerable
part in several of the world-religions; namely that which the
Persians called the ‘Best Reason,’ and which the Greeks knew
as Wisdom (σοφία) or the Word (λόγος). Sometimes an aspect
of the Deity, sometimes an emanation from him, and then again
a distinguishable personality, this figure is again and again
presented to our consideration. The personification of abstractions
appealed with special force to the Romans, for from the
earliest periods of their history they had raised temples to Faith
(<i>fides</i>), Concord (<i>concordia</i>), and other deified virtues; and its
character can perhaps best be appreciated by reference to the
personification of Light in Christian hymnology, both ancient
and modern:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sanctity of the elements.</div>

<p id="section13"><b>13.</b> Amongst the subsidiary, but still important, doctrines of
Persism, is that of the sanctity of the four elements.
Earth, air, fire and water are alike holy. Hence
the dead must not be buried, for that would be to defile the
earth; nor burned, for that would be to defile fire<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>; nor may
any impurity be thrown into the water. This respect for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
elements often appeared to strangers as worship of them<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.
Between the elements they sometimes discriminated, considering
earth and water as more akin to darkness and the evil spirit, but
fire and air to light and the good spirit<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. The element of fire
they held in special reverence, so that at all times they have
been called fire-worshippers<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. More careful observers have
always recognised them as monotheists, distinguished by a
certain rapturous language in their description of the deity
which they refused to picture in any concrete shape<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. They
were also zealous that their teaching should find its expression
in a healthy social and political life<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. In the education of the
young they laid a special stress on speaking the truth<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alexander in the East.</div>

<p id="section14"><b>14.</b> ‘The Gymnosophists taught philosophy to the people
of India<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.’ Who are the teachers thus indicated?
An answer may be found, though of a later date,
in Plutarch’s ‘Life of Alexander,’ where he describes the
meeting of Alexander with some eminent gymnosophists, who
had stirred up opposition to his rule:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘[Alexander] captured ten of the Indian philosophers called Gymnosophistae<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>;
who had been instrumental in causing Sabbas to revolt, and had
done much mischief to the Macedonians. These men are renowned for
their short, pithy answers, and Alexander put difficult questions to all of
them, telling them that he would first put to death the man who answered
him worst, and so the rest in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The first was asked whether he thought the living or the dead to be the
more numerous. He answered “The living, for the dead are not.”</p>

<p>The second was asked, “Which breeds the largest animals, the sea or the
land?” He answered “The land, for the sea is only a part of it.”</p>

<p>The third was asked, “Which is the cleverest of beasts?” He answered

<p>The fourth was asked why he made Sabbas rebel. He answered
“Because I wished him either to live or to die with honour.”</p>

<p>The fifth was asked, which he thought was first, the day or the night.
He answered “The day was first, by one day.” As he saw that the king was
surprised by this answer, he added “Impossible questions require impossible
answers.”</p>

<p>Alexander now asked the sixth how a man could make himself most
beloved. He answered “By being very powerful, and yet not feared by his
subjects.”</p>

god. He answered “By doing that which it is impossible for a man to do.”</p>

<p>The next was asked which was the stronger, life or death. He answered
“Life, because it endures such terrible suffering.”</p>

<p>The last, being asked how long it was honourable for a man to live,
answered “As long as he thinks it better for him to live than to die.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Were the Gymnosophists Buddhists?</div>

<p id="section15"><b>15.</b> In these ‘gymnosophists’ it is easy to recognise a type
familiar to Indian antiquity. These men, who have
almost dispensed with clothing and know nothing
of the luxuries or even the conveniences of life, are
nevertheless influential leaders of the people. They,
like the Persians, have broken away from the old religions; they
talk lightly of the gods, and do not guide their actions by any
decrees supposed divine. The sight of human sorrow fills them
with sympathy for the ills of life, and makes them doubt whether
death is not the better choice. Their ethical standard is high,
and includes both courage and gentleness. That they are
Buddhist monks is probable enough, but not certain, because
India contained at this time many sects professing similar
principles. But the teaching of Gautama, the Buddha or ‘enlightened,’
represents to us in the most definite form the nature
of this propaganda. It implies a revolt against national rivalries,
ritualist observances, and polytheistic beliefs; it is severely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
practical, and inculcates obedience to reason and universal
benevolence; and it is spread from East to West by devoted
bands of ascetic missionaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhist teaching.</div>

<p id="section16"><b>16.</b> The fundamental teachings of Buddhism appear clearly
in the traditional account of the <i>Sermon of Benares</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This is the holy truth of Sorrow; birth is Sorrow, age is Sorrow, disease
is Sorrow, death is Sorrow; to be joined with the unloved
is Sorrow, to be parted from the loved is Sorrow; to lose
one’s desire is Sorrow; shortly, the five-fold clinging to
existence is Sorrow.</p>

<p>‘This is the holy truth of the Origin of Sorrow; it is the thirst to be,
leading from birth to birth, finding its pleasure here and there; the thirst for
pleasure, the thirst to be, the thirst to be prosperous.</p>

<p>This is the holy truth of the Removing of Sorrow; the removal of the
thirst by destroying desire, by letting it go, by cutting oneself off from it,
separating from it, giving it no place.</p>

<p>This is the holy truth of the Path to the Removing of Sorrow; it is the
holy Path of eight branches, which is called Right Belief, Right Aspiration,
Right Word, Right Act, Right Life, Right Effort, Right Meditation, Right
Annihilation of Self<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Specially characteristic of Buddhism is that gentleness of
temper, instinctively opposed to all anger and cruelty, which no
provocation can turn aside. We read in the Dhammapada:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Hatred does not cease by hatred at any time; hatred ceases by love;
this is an old rule. Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome
evil by good; let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by truth<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Buddhists and Cynics.</div>

<p id="section17"><b>17.</b> The doctrines of Buddhism were not inculcated in
India alone. From the first it was a missionary
religion; and its emissaries must often have
appeared in the Hellenistic world, promising ‘to seekers after
God eternal communion with his very essence, to the weary
pessimist eternal forgetfulness<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.’ From contemporary Indian
inscriptions we learn of missionaries sent out by Açoka, the
first great Buddhist king of India, ‘with healing herbs and yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
more healing doctrine’<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> to Ptolemy II king of Egypt, Antiochus
of Syria, and others, before the year 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; and this mission
can have been but one out of many. It thus appears very
remarkable that we have no record of Buddhist communities
established in the Greco-Roman world. But if the name of
Gautama remained unknown to the West, and his community
had no formal adherents, the manner of life of his apostles did
not lack imitators. In the Cynic preacher the Buddhist monk
reappears. In Greek literature he is usually an object of
ridicule; his uncouth appearance, his pitiable poverty, and his
unconventional speech give constant opportunity for the wit of
his critics. But the Cynics carried with them not only the outward
garb of the Buddhist monks, but also their lofty ethical
standard, their keen sympathy with human troubles, and their
indifference to purely speculative problems<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. In spite of the
contempt heaped upon them (or perhaps in consequence of it)
they gradually won respect and admiration as the sincere friends
and helpers of the poor. Thus Buddhism at its best is pictured
for us in the sketches drawn by Epictetus of Diogenes and the
Cynic preachers of his own day, of which the following are
examples:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Did Diogenes love nobody, who was so kind and so much a lover of
all that for mankind in general he willingly undertook so much labour and
bodily suffering? He did love mankind, but how? As became a minister of
God, at the same time caring for men, and being also subject to God. For
this reason all the earth was his country, and not one particular place; and
when he was taken prisoner he did not regret Athens nor his associates and
friends there, but even he became familiar with the pirates and tried to
improve them; and being sold afterwards he lived in Corinth as before at
Athens. Thus is freedom acquired<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘And how is it possible that a man who has nothing, who is naked,
houseless, without a hearth, squalid, without a slave, without a city, can pass
a life that flows easily? See, God has sent you a man to shew you it is
possible. Look at me, who am without a city, without a house, without
possessions, without a slave; I sleep on the ground; I have no wife, no
children, no praetorium, but only the earth and heavens, and one poor
cloak. And what do I want? Am I not without sorrow? Am I not without
fear? Am I not free? When did any of you see me failing in the object of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
my desire, or ever falling into that which I would avoid? did I ever blame
God or man? did I ever accuse any man? did any of you ever see me
with sorrowful countenance?</p>

<p>This is the language of the Cynics, this their character, this their
purpose<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Except that a simple form of theism has replaced the
Buddhist atheism, there is hardly a word here that we might
not expect from a Buddhist monk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section18"><b>18.</b> The Stoic philosophy was founded by Zeno of Citium
(350-260 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). Although he lived and taught at
Athens, his youth was spent in a city that was half
Phoenician, and many of his most distinguished followers had
a like association with the Eastern world. The system deals
with all the great themes touched upon by Chaldaism, Persism,
and Buddhism. Like the first, it insists that there exists an
unchanging Destiny, according to which events throughout the
universe are predetermined from all eternity. Like the second,
it sets up as claiming the worship and allegiance of men a
Supreme Deity, who governs the world with boundless power
and benevolent will, and is manifested to men as the Logos or
‘divine Word.’ In its interpretation of the physical universe it
accepts as a first principle a living and creative fire, ultimately
identical with the deity, and containing the germs of the whole
creation. It sees in the will of man an independent and divine
power, subject to no compulsion from without, but attaining its
highest and best by willing submission to the Supreme Being.
In its practical ethics, though it does not advocate the suppression
of all desires, it so far agrees with Buddhism as to hold
that happiness is only found in the subordination of individual
claims to the voice of universal reason. Finally, its teachers
are actively engaged in propagating its doctrines and guiding
its disciples. Stoicism has, in short, the inward and outward
characteristics of the other great movements we have described,
and may claim without presumption to be reckoned amongst
the world-religions<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comprehensiveness of the Stoic view.</div>

<p id="section19"><b>19.</b> If however we reckon Stoicism amongst the world-religions,
we must not forget that of all of them
it is the most philosophical, and this in a double
sense. In the first place the founders of Stoicism
are conscious of the problems to which preceding schools of
thought have endeavoured to find answers, and attempt to
reconcile or at any rate to bring into relation the answers which
their predecessors have found. Secondly they are greatly
occupied with intellectual problems, and clearness of thought
is to them almost equally important with rightness of thought.
The theory of Fate which we have attributed to the Chaldaeans
is to the plain man irreconcileable with the doctrine of the
government of the world by a Supreme Deity; yet the Stoics
hold both dogmas. The theory of the freedom of the human
will is a limitation equally of the dominion of Fate and of that
of the Deity: the Stoics maintain the freedom of the human
will and refuse to admit the limitation of either power. The
Persians maintained that the power of the principle of Good
was balanced by that of the principle of Evil; and from this
they drew what seemed to be the legitimate conclusion that
man may choose to obey the one or the other, to do good or to
do evil. The Stoics omitted the principle of Evil altogether
from their scheme, and yet maintained the theory of the moral
choice. To understand the Stoic system it is necessary to know
exactly in what balance its different elements were maintained,
and to avoid identifying it with other systems, ancient or modern,
which are more sharply cut. Thus when it is commonly asserted
that Stoicism on its religious side is Pantheism, the very brevity
of this summary must create suspicion. Certainly the Stoics
frequently speak of the universe as divine; but they hold with
equal firmness the doctrines that the universe is governed by
Providence, and that human perversity may thwart the divine
purpose, both being doctrines which in ancient as in modern
times are associated with Theism, and held to be inconsistent
with pantheistic views.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God and the ‘Word.’</div>

<p id="section20"><b>20.</b> A similar difficulty confronts us when we ask whether
the deity of the Stoics is to be considered as personal.
All the terms commonly used in association<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
with a personal deity are adopted by the Stoics: their god is
Lord and Father. But then they use with equal freedom terms
commonly associated with materialism: for the Supreme Being
is to them body or stuff, a primitive fire which converts itself
by natural laws into every form of being. For this reason the
Stoics are commonly called materialists, and yet the main body
of their teaching is contrary to that usually associated with
materialism<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. Further, beside the personal and the material
conceptions of the Deity, they adopted and developed a conception
which exercised an extraordinary influence over other
systems, when they attributed the exercise of all the powers of
deity to the divine Word, which from one point of view is the
deity himself, and from another is something which emanates
from him and is in some way distinct. Thus the term ‘God,’
which to children and child-like religions appears so simple, is
in the Stoic system extraordinarily complex; and its full content
cannot be grasped without a willingness to revise the meaning
of many conceptions which seem firmly established, such as
those of personality, material, and quality. If we are to suppose
that the Stoic conception of the Word arose ultimately from
similar conceptions in Hebraism or Persism, by which the voice
of a personal God attained to a quasi-independent personality,
we must allow that the Stoics made use of this term with a
boldness and consistency which from the time of their appearance
brought it into the forefront of religious and metaphysical controversy.
Through the Stoics the doctrine of the Word passed
into the systems of Judaism and Christianity, to perform in
each the like service by reconciling doctrines apparently contradictory.
Of all the systems we may perhaps say that
Stoicism makes the fewest new assertions or negations, but
introduces the most numerous interpretations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Influence of Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section21"><b>21.</b> We have comparatively little means of judging of the
influence of Stoicism in the world of Asia Minor,
but incidentally we may infer that it was very considerable.
In Athens the moral earnestness of its teachers found
little response in public feeling, whilst it laid the exponents of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
its tenets open to many a sharp thrust from keen critics whose
constructive powers were after all inferior. In Rome itself
Stoicism took root rapidly. The brilliant circle that gathered
round Scipio Africanus the younger was imbued with its ideals;
Cato, the leading republican of the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, was a
living representative of its principles; and Cicero and Brutus,
with many others less known to fame, were greatly influenced
by it. In the first century of the principate Stoicism imparted
a halo of heroism to a political and social opposition which
otherwise would evoke little sympathy<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; in the second century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> its influence was thrown on the side of the government;
the civilized world was ruled under its flag, and its principles
were embodied in successive codes of law which are not yet
extinct. Its direct supremacy was not long-lived; for at the
very time when a Stoic philosopher sits in the seat of the
Caesars its followers seem to be losing their hold on its most
important doctrines. It came into sharp conflict with Christianity
on matters of outward observance; but in the cores of the two
systems there was much likeness<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, and from Stoic homes were
drawn the most intelligent advocates of the newer faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Judaism.</div>

<p id="section22"><b>22.</b> By Judaism we mean here the way of thinking which
was prevalent in the Jewish world from the date of
the return from Babylon to that of the destruction
of Jerusalem. Judaism was of course by no means restricted to
the soil of Palestine; it was carried by the diffusion of the
Jewish race to all the coasts of the Mediterranean; besides its
national centre at Jerusalem, it included a great centre of learning
at Alexandria, and its branches, as we have seen<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, extended
to the south of Egypt. The chief external impulse which
affected it was the spread of Persism. The two systems agreed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
in their belief in a God of heaven, and in their dislike to idol-worship;
and it can be no matter of wonder if one party at
least among the Jews readily accepted the more strictly Persian
doctrines of the ministry of angels, the struggle between good
and evil, the immortality of the soul, and the reward after death,
as well as such observances as the washing of hands<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. Strong
Persian influence has been traced in the book of Daniel<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, and as
Jewish speculation developed at Alexandria, it took up the use
of the Greek language, and so came into touch with the
influences that were moulding thought throughout Asia Minor<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.
The most interesting and elevated production of Alexandrine
Judaism is the book known as the <i>Wisdom of Solomon</i>, probably
composed in the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Philo the Jew.</div>

<p id="section24"><b>24.</b> The fusion of Greek and Judaic modes of thought is
most complete in the works of Philo the Jew
(c. 20 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>-54 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). This writer in commenting
upon the books of the Old Testament, finds himself able by way
of interpretation to introduce large parts of Greek philosophies.
The place of Wisdom in the writer last named is taken in his
works by the Logos or ‘Word<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>’; and the ‘Word’ is many times
described as an emanation of the deity, after the Persian
fashion<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. Without anticipating the further discussion of this
philosophical conception, we may well notice here how characteristic
it is of an age which paid boundless homage to reason,
and how it supplies a counterpoise to conceptions of the deity
which are rigidly personal. But Philo is of still more direct
service to the study of Stoicism, because he had so completely
absorbed the system that, where other authorities fail us, we
may often trust to his expositions for a knowledge of details
of the Stoic system.</p>

<p>Another work of about the same period is the <i>Fourth book
of the Maccabees</i>, in which Stoic ethics, only slightly disguised,
are illustrated from Jewish history. In this fusion of Hebraic
and Hellenistic thought, unfortunately interrupted by political
convulsions, eminent modern Jews have recognised the natural
development of the teaching of the Hebrew prophets<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity.</div>

<p id="section25"><b>25.</b> The foregoing discussions will already have suggested
that Christianity is bound by intimate ties to the
other world-religions; though it is beyond our
present purpose to examine the precise nature of those ties.
It is pre-eminently concerned with the breaking down of Jewish
nationalism, and its constant appeal to ‘the truth’ is essentially
the same as the appeal of kindred systems to ‘wisdom’ or
‘philosophy.’ The Lord’s Prayer, addressed to the ‘Father in
heaven,’ and with its further references to ‘The Name,’ ‘The
Kingdom,’ ‘The Will,’ ‘temptation,’ and ‘the Evil One,’ reflects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the principal conceptions of Persism, of which we are again
reminded in the Apocalypse by the reference to the ‘seven
spirits of God<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.’ The Sermon on the Mount has been, not
without reason, compared to the Buddhist sermon of Benares.
With Stoicism Christianity has special ties, both direct and
indirect. Its chief apostle was Paul of Tarsus, who was brought
up in a city from which more than one eminent Stoic teacher
had proceeded<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, and whose ways of thinking are penetrated by
Stoic conceptions. The most profound exponent of its theology
(the author of the <i>Gospel according to John</i>) placed in the forefront
of his system the doctrine of the ‘Word’ which directly
or (more probably) indirectly he derived from Stoic sources.
The early church writers felt the kinship of thought without
perceiving the historical relation. To them Cicero in his Stoic
works was ‘anima naturaliter Christiana’; and they could only
explain the lofty teachings of Seneca by the belief that he was
a secret convert of the apostle Paul<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Parallelism between Stoic
and Christian phraseology is indeed so frequently traced that it
may be well to emphasize the need of caution. It is not by
single phrases, often reflecting only the general temper of the
times, that we can judge the relation of the two systems; it is
necessary also to take into account the general framework and
the fundamental principles of each.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Druidism.</div>

<p id="section26"><b>26.</b> Of the systems named by Aristotle far the least known
to us is Druidism. It appeared to Caesar and other
Romans to be the national religion of the Gauls
and Britons, exactly as Magism appeared to the Greeks to be
the national religion of the Persians. But other evidence indicates
that Druidism was a reformed religion or philosophy, not
unlike Persism in its principles. The training of Druidical
students was long and arduous; it claimed to introduce them to
a knowledge of heavenly deities denied to the rest of the world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
and to reveal to them the immortality of the soul. Our best
authority is the Latin poet Lucan:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘To you alone it has been granted to know the gods and the powers
of heaven; or (it may be) to you alone to know them wrongly. You dwell
in deep forests and far-away groves: according to your teaching the shades
do not make their way to the still regions of Erebus or the grey realm of
Dis below; the same spirit guides a new body in another world; if you
know well what you say, then death is but an interlude in life. If not, at
least the peoples, on whom the northern star gazes directly, are happy in
their illusion; for the greatest of terrors, the fear of death, is nothing to
them. Hence it comes that their warriors’ hearts are ready to meet the
sword, and their souls have a welcome for death, and they scorn to be
thrifty with life, in which they can claim a second share<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Druidism, like Stoicism, seems to have prepared its adherents
for a specially ready acceptance of Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The goal not reached yet.</div>

<p id="section27"><b>27.</b> The story of the world-religions, with their countless
prophets, teachers, confessors and martyrs, has its
tragic side. We ask what was attained by so much
study and self-denial, such courageous defiance of
custom and prejudice, such bold strivings after the unattainable,
so many hardly spent lives and premature deaths, and feel
puzzled to find a reply. To the problems proposed the world-religions
gave in turn every possible answer. Some found life
sweet, others bitter; some bowed before the inexorable rule of
destiny, others believed in a personal and benevolent government
of the universe; some looked forward to a life after death, others
hoped for annihilation. Their theories crystallized into dogmas,
and as such became the banners under which national hatreds
once more sought outlet in bloodshed. Their adherents sacrificed
everything in the hope of reaching certain and scientific truth,
and, at the end of all, religion still appears the whole world over
to be in conflict with science, and the thousand years during
which Wisdom was counted more precious than riches are often
looked back upon as a time of human aberration and childishness.
It is not to be denied that thousands of noble spirits
set out during this period for a goal that they never reached;
and those who are inclined to destructive criticism may plausibly
characterise their enterprise as vanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The path still onward.</div>

<p id="section28"><b>28.</b> It is the task of literary research to pierce through this
limited view, and to trace the real effect of philosophical
effort on the life of individuals and nations.
All over the civilized world it raised a race of heroes,
struggling not for power or splendour as in the epoch of barbarism,
but for the good of their fellow-men. It gave a new value to life,
and trampled under foot the fear of death. It united the nations,
and spread the reign of law and justice. Where its influence has
weakened, the world has not changed for the better; so that the
very failures of the world-religions most attest their value. India
has relapsed from Buddhism, its own noblest work, to its earlier
creeds, and they still bar its path against social progress. Europe,
no longer united by the sentiment of a catholic religion, and increasingly
indifferent to literary sympathies, is falling back into
the slough of frontier impediments and racial hatreds. From
all this there is no way out except in the old-fashioned quest of
truth and good will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Estimates of Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section29"><b>29.</b> Both in ancient and in modern times the importance of
Stoicism has been very variously estimated, according
as the critic has set up a purely literary standard,
or has taken into account historical influence. To
those who look upon philosophy as it is embodied in books, and
forms a subject for mental contemplation and aesthetic enjoyment,
the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle have always seemed
of far higher rank. As contributions to the progress of humanity,
in politics and law, in social order and in the inventive adaptation
of material surroundings, they can hardly claim to approach
any one of the systems discussed in this chapter. But it is with
no wish to depreciate the great masterpieces of Hellenic culture
that we now set against the criticisms of some of its ardent
advocates the maturer judgment of writers who have approached
with greater sympathy the study of the Hellenistic and Roman
worlds. ‘In Plato and Aristotle,’ says Zeller, ‘Greek philosophy
reached its greatest perfection<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.’ ‘Its bloom was short-lived<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.’
‘Greece was brought into contact with the Eastern nations,
whereby it became subject to a back-current of Oriental
thought<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.’ ‘With the decline of political independence the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
mental powers of the nation were broken past remedy<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.’
‘What could be expected in such an age, but that philosophy
would become practical, if indeed it were studied at all<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>?’ To
minds of another temper it does not seem so fatal that ‘philosophy
should become practical.’ ‘It should be insisted,’ says
Prof. Mahaffy, ‘that the greatest practical inheritance the Greeks
left in philosophy was not the splendour of Plato, or the vast
erudition of Aristotle, but the practical systems of Zeno and
Epicurus, and the scepticism of Pyrrho. In our own day every
man is either a Stoic, an Epicurean, or a Sceptic<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.’ The greatness
of Stoicism in particular was eloquently recognised by a
French writer of the eighteenth century: ‘elle seule savait faire
les citoyens, elle seule faisait les grands hommes, elle seule faisait
les grands empereurs<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>!’ With these tributes may be compared
that paid by a writer who approaches the subject from the standpoint
of modern philosophy and theology. ‘[Stoicism] has
perennial fascination; and there are not wanting signs that it
appeals with special attractiveness to cultured minds at the
present day. It has both speculative and practical value; its
analysis of human nature and its theory of knowledge, no less
than its ethical teaching, giving insight into the problems of the
universe and the right mode of guiding life. As an important
stage in the march of philosophical thought, and as a luminous
chapter in the history of natural theology, it solicits our attention
and will repay our study<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interpretative Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section30"><b>30.</b> Judgments so contradictory reveal the fact that ancient
divergencies of philosophic sympathies have their
counterparts to-day; and perhaps in studying and
judging the systems of antiquity a little more is
needed of the sympathy and interpretative elasticity which every
man unconsciously uses in maintaining the political, philosophic
and religious views to which he is attracted by inheritance or
personal conviction. Thus to understand Stoicism fully a man
must himself become for the time being a Stoic. As such he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
will no longer bind himself by the letter of the school authorities.
In many a phrase they use he will recognise an obsolete habit
of thought, an exaggerated opposition, a weak compliance in the
face of dominant opinions, or a mistaken reliance upon what
once seemed logical conclusions. At other points he will see
difficulties felt to which an answer can now easily be supplied.
At each step he will ask, not so much what the Stoics thought,
but what a Stoic must necessarily think. Whilst constantly
referring to the original authorities, he will allow much to be
forgotten, and in other cases he will draw out more meaning
than the writers themselves set in their words. If he can walk,
boldly but not without caution, on this path, he will assuredly
find that Stoicism throws light on all the great questions to
which men still seek answers, and that to some at least it still
holds out a beckoning hand.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Greek thought.</div>

<p id="section31"><b>31.</b> We have seen already that the great problems of which
Stoicism propounds one solution were agitated
during the millennium which preceded the Christian
era alike in India, Persia and Asia Minor on the one hand, and
in Greece, Italy and the Celtic countries on the other. To the
beginnings of this movement we are unable to assign a date;
but the current of thought appears on the whole to have moved
from East to West. But just at the same time the influence of
Greek art and literature spreads from West to East; and it is
to the crossing and interweaving of these two movements that
we owe almost all the light thrown on this part of the history of
human thought. The early history of Stoicism has reached us
entirely through the Greek language, and is bound up with the
history of Greek literature and philosophy<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. But long before
Stoicism came into existence other movements similar in kind
had reached Greece; and the whole of early Greek literature,
and especially its poetry, is rich in contributions to the discussion
of the physical and ethical problems to which Stoicism
addressed itself. From the storehouse of this earlier literature
the Stoics drew many of their arguments and illustrations; the
speculations of Heraclitus and the life of Socrates were especially
rich in suggestions to them. The study of Greek literature and
philosophy as a whole is therefore indispensable for a full
appreciation of Stoicism; and the way has been made easier of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
late by excellent treatises, happily available in the English
language, dealing with the general development of philosophic
and religious thought in Greece<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Here it is only possible to
refer quite shortly to those writers and teachers to whom Stoicism
is most directly indebted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homer.</div>

<p id="section32"><b>32.</b> Although the <span class="smcap">Homeric poems</span> include representations
of gods and men corresponding to the epoch of
national gods and to other still earlier stages of
human thought, nevertheless they are pervaded by at least the
dawning light of the period of the world-religions. Tales of the
gods that are bloodthirsty or coarse are kept in the background;
and though heroes like Agamemnon, Achilles, and Ajax move
in an atmosphere of greed, bloodshed, and revenge, yet all of
them are restrained both in word and in act by a strong feeling
of self-respect, the αἰδώς or shamefastness which entirely differentiates
them from the heroes of folk-lore; in particular, the
typical vices of gluttony, drunkenness, and sexual unrestraint
are amongst the things of which it is a shame to speak without
reserve. The gods are many, and in human shape; yet they
are somewhat fairer than men, and something of the heavenly
brilliance in which the Persian archangels are wrapped seems
to encircle also the heights where the gods dwell on mount
Olympus<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. Gradually too there comes to light amidst the
picture of the many gods something resembling a supreme
power, sometimes impersonally conceived as Fate (αἶσα, μοῖρα),
sometimes more personally as the Fate of Zeus, most commonly
of all as Zeus himself, elevated in rank above all other gods<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
Thus Zeus is not only king, but also father of gods and men<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>;
he is the dispenser of happiness to men, ‘to the good and the
evil, to each one as he will<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>,’ and the distributor of gracious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
gifts<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, unbounded in power<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and in knowledge<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. The gods
again, in spite of the many tales of violence attached to their
names, exercise a moral governance over the world. ‘They
love not froward deeds, but they reverence justice and the
righteous acts of men<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>’; ‘in the likeness of strangers from far
countries, they put on all manner of shapes, and wander through
the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of
men<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.’</p>

<p>Whilst therefore the philosophers of later times could rightly
object to Homer that he told of the gods tales neither true nor
worthy of their nature, there was on the other hand much in the
<i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, and particularly in the latter, which was in
harmony with philosophical conceptions. It was not without
reason that the Stoics themselves made of Ulysses, who in
Homer plays but little part in fighting, an example of the man
of wisdom and patience, who knows men and cities, and who
through self-restraint and singleness of purpose at last wins his
way to the goal<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. From this starting-point the whole of the
<i>Odyssey</i> is converted into a ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’; the enchantress
Circe represents the temptations of gluttony, which turns men
into swine<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; the chant of the Sirens is an allegory of the enticements
of sensual pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hesiod.</div>

<p id="section33"><b>33.</b> In <span class="smcap">Hesiod</span> (8th century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) we find the first attempt
to construct a history of the universe; his <i>Theogony</i>
is the forerunner of the Cosmology which later on
is a recognised part of philosophy. Here in the company of the
personal gods we find not only the personified lights of heaven,
Sun and Moon, but also such figures as those of Earth and
Ocean, Night and Day, Heaven and Hell, Fate, Sleep, and
Death, all bearing witness to the emergence of the spirit of
speculation. In Hesiod again we first find the description of
the ‘watchmen of Jove,’ who are no longer the gods themselves
as in Homer, but an intermediate class of beings, corresponding
to the Persian angels and the δαίμονες of later Greek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Thrice ten thousand are the servants of Zeus, immortal, watchmen over
mortal men; these watch deeds of justice and of wickedness, walking all
ways up and down the earth, clothed in the mist<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>But it is in his ethical standards that Hesiod is more directly
a forerunner of the Stoic school: for neither the warlike valour
nor the graceful self-control of the hero appeals to him, but the
stern sense of justice and the downright hard work of the plain
man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Full across the way of Virtue the immortal gods have set the sweat of
the brow; long and steep is the path that reaches to her, and rough at the
beginning; but when you reach the highest point, hard though it is, in the
end it becomes easy<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Orphic poems.</div>

<p id="section34"><b>34.</b> Between Epic and Attic literature stands the poetry of
the ‘Orphic’ movement, belonging to the sixth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and exercising a wide influence over
various schools of philosophy in the succeeding centuries. For
an account of this movement the reader must look elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>;
here we can only notice that it continued the cosmological
speculations of Hesiod’s <i>Theogony</i>, and in particular developed
a strain of pantheism which is echoed in the Stoic poets.
According to an Orphic poet</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Zeus is the first and the last, the head and the foot, the male and the
female, Earth and Heaven, Night and Day; he is the one force, the one
great deity, the creator, the alluring power of love; for all these things are
immanent in the person of Zeus<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Here amidst the fusion of poetry and theology we first see
the budding principle of philosophic monism, the reaching after
a unity which will comprehend all things. To the same school
is attributed the doctrine that ‘the human soul is originally and
essentially divine<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hylozoists.</div>

<p id="section35"><b>35.</b> To the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> belong also the earliest Greek
philosophers who are known to us by name. In
all of these the early polytheism is either abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
or becomes so dim in its outlines that the origin and governing
force of the universe is sought in quite other directions. The
philosophers of Ionia busied themselves with the problem of the
elements. <span class="smcap">Thales</span> of Miletus was a man of many attainments;
he had travelled both in Egypt and in Babylon, and was an
active political reformer. To him water was the primary substance,
from which all others proceeded and to which they
returned<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. <span class="smcap">Anaximander</span> of the same town was the first who
undertook to give the Greeks a map of the whole known world.
To him it seemed that the primary matter could not be the
same as any visible substance, but must be a protoplasm of
undefined character (ἄπειρον), capable of assuming in turn all
shapes<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. <span class="smcap">Anaximenes</span> (once more of Miletus) assumed air as
the first principle, and derived the other elements from it by
processes of condensation (πύκνωσις) and rarefaction<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. But on
one point all the Ionian philosophers were agreed: the primary
substance was the cause of its own motion; they were ‘hylozoists,’
since they hold that matter (ὕλη) is a living thing
(ζῷον). They are from the standpoint of physics ‘monists,’ as
opposed to those who hold matter and life, or matter and force,
to be two things eternally distinct, and are therefore ‘dualists’
in their theory<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pythagoras.</div>

<p id="section36"><b>36.</b> To the same sixth century belong two other notable
philosophers. <span class="smcap">Pythagoras</span>, born in Samos about
575 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and like Thales, one who had travelled
widely, left his native land rather than submit to the rule of a
tyrant, and founded in Croton in Lower Italy a community half
religious and half political, which in its original form was not
long-lived. But a widespread tradition remained as to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
doctrines, in which the theory of Numbers held a leading position.
Pythagoras appears to have been a good mathematician and
astronomer, and followers of his school were at an early date led
to the doctrines of the rotation of the earth on its axis and the
central position of the sun in the planetary system<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. His name
is also connected with the theory of the transmigration of souls,
which we may suppose him to have derived ultimately from
some Indian source; and to the same country we must look as
having suggested to him and his followers the practice of abstaining
from animal food<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Xenophanes.</div>

<p id="section37"><b>37.</b> If we looked merely to the theories of the philosophers,
it might seem as if the old mythologies and theogonies
were already dead. But in fact the battle
was yet to come. <span class="smcap">Xenophanes</span> of Colophon (born circ. 580 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
witnessed in his youth the fall of Ionia before the conquering
progress of Cyrus king of Persia. Rather than submit to the
power of the invader he adopted the life of a wandering minstrel,
and finally settled in Elea, in Lower Italy, where he became the
founder of the Eleatic school. But in his religious convictions
he was whole-heartedly on the Persian side. ‘There is one God,
greatest amongst gods<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and men, not like mortal men in bodily
shape or in mind<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.’ Thus the worship of many gods and that
of images of the deity are alike condemned; and it is probable
that in this false worship he found the cause of his country’s
fall. With the lack of historic sense which is characteristic of
the zealous reformer, he condemned Homer and Hesiod as
teachers of immorality, since they ‘ascribed to the gods theft,
adultery, and deceit, and all acts that are counted shame and blame
amongst men<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.’ With keen criticism he pointed out that myths
as to the birth of the gods dishonoured them just as much as if
they related their deaths; for on either supposition there is a
time when the gods do not exist<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. The conception of the deity
formed by Xenophanes seems to approach Pantheism or Nature-worship,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
and so far to foreshadow the Stoic deity; but the
fragments that survive of his works are insufficient to make this
point clear<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. The successors of Xenophanes did not inherit his
religious zeal, but they emphasized all the more the philosophic
principle of an ultimate Unity in all things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heraclitus.</div>

<p id="section38"><b>38.</b> With the opening of the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we reach
<span class="smcap">Heraclitus</span> of Ephesus, a philosopher of the
highest importance to us, since the Stoics afterwards
accepted his teaching as the foundation of their own
system of physics. The varied speculations of the sixth century
were all examined by Heraclitus, and all found wanting by him;
his own solutions of the problems of the world are set forth in
a prophetic strain, impressive by its dignity, obscure in its form,
and lending itself to much variety of interpretation. For the
opinions of the crowd, who are misled by their senses, he had no
respect<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; but even learning does not ensure intelligence<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>,
unless men are willing to be guided by the ‘Word,’ the universal
reason<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. The senses shew us in the universe a perpetual flowing:
fire changes to water (sky to cloud), water to earth (in rainfall),
which is the downward path; earth changes to water (rising
mist), and water to fire, which is the upward path<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. Behind
these changes the Word points to that which is one and unchanging<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.
Anaximander did well when he pointed to the
unlimited as the primary stuff, but it is better to describe it as
an ‘ever-living fire<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.’ Out of this fire all things come, and into
it they shall all be resolved<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. Of this ever-living fire a spark is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
buried in each man’s body; whilst the body lives, this spark,
the soul, may be said to be dead<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; but when the body dies it
escapes from its prison, and enters again on its proper life.
The ‘Word’ is from everlasting<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>; through the Word all things
happen<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>; it is the universal Law which holds good equally in
the physical world and in the soul of man. For man’s soul
there is a moral law, which can be reached only by studying
the plan of the world in which we live<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. But of this law
men are continually forgetful; they live as in a dream, unconscious
of it; it calls to them once and again, but they do
not hear it<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. Most of all it is needed in the government of the
state; for ‘he who speaks with understanding must take his
foothold on what is common to all; for all human laws are
nourished by the one divine law<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Word.</div>

<p id="section39"><b>39.</b> The general import of the physical teaching of
Heraclitus, and the indebtedness of the Stoics to
it, have long been recognised: the bearing of this
teaching upon religion, ethics and politics is a more disputable
matter. Does Heraclitus by the ‘Logos’ which he so often
names mean merely his own reasoning and message? is he
speaking of the common reason of mankind? or does the
term suggest to him a metaphysical abstraction, a divine power
through which the world is created and governed? For the
fuller meaning we have analogies in the beliefs of Persism before
Heraclitus, and of Stoics, Judaists, and Christians afterwards.
The latest commentator, adopting this explanation, sums it up
in three propositions: first, the ‘Logos’ is eternal, being both
pre-existent and everlasting, like the world-god of Xenophanes;
secondly, all things both in the material and in the spiritual
world happen through the ‘Logos’; it is a cosmic principle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
‘common’ or ‘universal’; and in the third place, it is the duty
of man to obey this ‘Logos,’ and so to place himself in harmony
with the rest of nature. And accordingly, in agreement with
many recent writers, he adopts the translation ‘the Word’ as
on the whole the most adequate<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. Even the Romans found
it impossible to translate λόγος by any single word, and they
therefore adopted the phrase <i>ratio et oratio</i> (reason and speech);
in modern language it seems clearly to include also the broad
notion of ‘Universal Law’ or the ‘Laws of Nature.’ If we can
rightly attribute to Heraclitus all that is thus included in the
interpretation of this one word, he certainly stands out as a
great creative power in Greek philosophy, harmonizing by
bold generalizations such diverse provinces as those of physics,
religion, and ethics; ‘he was the first [in Greece, we must understand]
to build bridges, which have never since been destroyed,
between the natural and the spiritual life<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.’ It is to the Stoics
almost alone that we owe it that teaching so suggestive and
so practical was converted into a powerful social and intellectual
force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zarathustra and Heraclitus.</div>

<p id="section40"><b>40.</b> The prominence given to fire in the system of Heraclitus
has very naturally suggested that his doctrine is
borrowed from that of Zarathustra<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. The historical
circumstances are not unfavourable to this suggestion.
Ionia was conquered in turn by Cyrus and Darius, and
definitely annexed by Persia about 496 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, that is, at the very
time at which Heraclitus taught. Moreover the Persian invasion
was akin to a religious crusade, and had for a principal aim the
stamping out of the idle and superstitious habit of worshipping
images, by which (according to the Persians) the true God was
dishonoured. The elevated character of the Persian religion
could hardly fail to attract learned Greeks, already dissatisfied
with the crude mythology of their own people. Further, the
resemblance between the teaching of Zarathustra and that of
Heraclitus is not restricted to the language used of the divine
fire; the doctrines of an all-creating, all-pervading Wisdom, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
λόγος or Word, and of the distinction between the immortal
soul and the corruptible body, are common to both. But the
differences between the two systems are almost equally striking.
Heraclitus is a monist; according to him all existences are
ultimately one. Zarathustra taught a principle of Evil, everywhere
opposed to the Good Spirit, and almost equally powerful;
his system is dualist<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[45a]</a>. Zarathustra is not free from nationalism,
Heraclitus is cosmopolitan. In the Ephesian system we find
no trace of the belief in Judgment after death, in Heaven, or
in Hell. We may in fact well believe that Heraclitus was
acquainted with Zoroastrianism and influenced by it, but we
have not the means to determine what the extent of that
influence was. It is related of him that he received (but declined)
an invitation to the court of Darius; and that his dead body was
given up to be torn to pieces by dogs in the Persian fashion<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[45b]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tragedians.</div>

<p id="section41"><b>41.</b> The development of philosophic thought at Athens
was, as we have noticed, much complicated by the
political relations of Greece to Persia. Although
the Persian empire had absorbed Asia Minor, it was decisively
repulsed in its attacks on Greece proper. Athens was the
centre of the resistance to it, and the chief glory of the victories
of Marathon (490 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and Salamis (480 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) fell to Athenian
statesmen and warriors. By these successes the Hellenes not
only maintained their political independence, but saved the
images of their gods from imminent destruction. A revival of
polytheistic zeal took place, as might have been expected. The
wealth and skill of Greece were ungrudgingly expended in the
achievement of masterpieces of the sculptor’s art, and their
housing in magnificent temples. But even so religious doctrines
strikingly similar to those of the Persians gained ground. The
same Aeschylus who (in his <i>Persae</i>) celebrates the defeat of the
national enemy, a few years later (in his <i>Agamemnon</i>) questions
whether the Supreme Ruler be really pleased with the Greek
title of Zeus, and the Greek method of worshipping him<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
His more conservative successor Sophocles was contented, in
the spirit of the Homeric bards, to eliminate from the old myths
all that seemed unworthy of the divine nature. Euripides adopts
a bolder tone. Reproducing the old mythology with exact
fidelity, he ‘assails the resulting picture of the gods with
scathing censure and flat contradiction<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.’ With equal vigour
he attacks the privileges of noble birth, and defends the rights
of the slave; he has a keen sympathy for all the misfortunes
that dog man’s life; but his ethical teaching in no way derives
its sanction from any theology. The Hellenes have lost confidence
in their inherited outlook on the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sophists.</div>

<p id="section42"><b>42.</b> The same problems which the poets discussed in the
city theatre were during the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the
themes of a class of men now becoming so
numerous as to form the nucleus of a new profession. These
were the ‘sophists,’ who combined the functions now performed
partly by the university professor, partly by the public journalist<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.
Dependent for their livelihood upon the fees of such pupils as
they could attract, and therefore sensitive enough to the applause
of the moment, they were distinguished from the philosophers
by a closer touch with the public opinion of the day, and
a keener desire for immediate results. Their contribution
to philosophic progress was considerable. Cultivating with
particular care the art of words, they created a medium by
which philosophic thought could reach the crowd of men
of average education; eager advocates of virtue and political
progress, they gave new hopes to a people which, in spite of
its material successes, was beginning to despair because of the
decay of its old moral and civic principles. In <span class="smcap">Prodicus</span> of
Ceos we find a forerunner of the popular Stoic teachers of the
period of the principate<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘A profound emotion shook the ranks of his audience when they heard
his deep voice, that came with so strange a sound from the frail body that
contained it. Now he would describe the hardships of human existence;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
now he would recount all the ages of man, beginning with the new-born
child, who greets his new home with wailing, and tracing his course to the
second childhood and the gray hairs of old age. Again he would rail at
death as a stony-hearted creditor, wringing his pledges one by one from his
tardy debtor, first his hearing, then his sight, next the free movement of his
limbs. At another time, anticipating Epicurus, he sought to arm his
disciples against the horrors of death by explaining that death concerned
neither the living nor the dead. As long as we live, death does not exist;
as soon as we die, we ourselves exist no longer<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>To Prodicus we owe the well-known tale of Hercules at the
parting of the ways, when Virtue on the one hand, and Pleasure
on the other, each invite him to join company with her<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. This
tale we shall find to be a favourite with the Roman philosophers.
The same Prodicus introduced a doctrine afterwards taken up
by the Cynics and the Stoics in succession, that of the ‘indifference’
of external advantages as distinct from the use to
which they are applied. He also propounded theories as to the
origin of the gods of mythology, explaining some of them as
personifications of the powers of nature, others as deified
benefactors of the human race<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; theories which later on were
adopted with zeal by the Stoic Persaeus<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. To another sophist,
<span class="smcap">Hippias</span> of Elis, we owe the doctrine of the ‘self-sufficiency’ of
virtue, again adopted both by Cynics and Stoics<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. <span class="smcap">Antiphon</span>
was not only the writer of an ‘Art of Consolation,’ but also of
a treatise of extraordinary eloquence on political concord and
the importance of education. ‘If a noble disposition be planted
in a young mind, it will engender a flower that will endure to
the end, and that no rain will destroy, nor will it be withered by
drought<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Materialists.</div>

<p id="section43"><b>43.</b> Amongst the sophists of Athens was counted <span class="smcap">Anaxagoras</span>,
born at Clazomenae about 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and a
diligent student of the Ionic philosophers. But in
his explanation of nature he broke away from ‘hylozoism’ and
introduced a dualism of mind and matter. ‘From eternity all
things were together, but Mind stirred and ordered them<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
More famous was his contemporary <span class="smcap">Empedocles</span> of Agrigentum,
whose name is still held in honour by the citizens of that town.
In him we first find the list of elements reaching to four, earth,
air, fire, and water; and the doctrine that visible objects consist
of combinations of the elements in varying proportions, first
brought together by Love, then separated by Hatred. Just in
so far as Empedocles abandoned the quest after a single origin
for all things, his conceptions became fruitful as the basis of the
more limited study now known as Chemistry. His work was
carried further by <span class="smcap">Leucippus</span> and <span class="smcap">Democritus</span>, both of
Abdera, who for the four elements substituted invisible atoms,
of countless variety, moving by reason of their own weight in
an empty space. This simple and powerful analysis is capable
of dealing effectively with many natural phenomena, and with
comparatively slight alterations is still held to be valid in
chemical analysis, and exercises a wide influence over the
neighbouring sciences of physics and botany. When however
(as has frequently been the case both in ancient and modern
times) the attempt is made to build upon it a general philosophical
system, its failure to explain the cohesion of matter
in masses, the growth of plants and animals, and the phenomena
of mind, become painfully apparent. Such attempts roughly
correspond to the attitude of mind now called <i>materialism</i>,
because in them the atoms, endowed with the material properties
of solidity, shape, and weight alone, are conceived to be the
only true existences, all others being secondary and derivative.
This materialism (with some significant qualifications) was a
century later the central doctrine of Epicurus, and is of importance
to us by reason of its sharp contrast with the Stoic
system of physics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Socrates.</div>

<p id="section44"><b>44.</b> The value of these scientific speculations was not for
the time being fully recognised at Athens. It was
in the atmosphere of sophistic discussion, not free
from intellectual mists, but bracing to the exercise of civic and
even of martial virtue that <span class="smcap">Socrates</span> of Athens (circ. 469-399
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) grew to maturity. He set to his fellow-citizens an example
of the vigorous performance of duty. As a soldier he was brave
almost to rashness, and took an active part in three campaigns.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
As a magistrate he discharged his duty unflinchingly. After
the battle of Arginusae the ten Athenian generals were said to
have neglected the duty of succouring certain disabled ships
and the people loudly demanded that all should be condemned
to death by a single vote. Socrates was one of the presiding
senators, and he absolutely refused to concur in any such illegal
procedure<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[56a]</a>. Again, when Athens was under the rule of the
Thirty, Socrates firmly refused to obey their unjust orders<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.
But when himself condemned to death, he refused to seize an
opportunity for flight which was given him; for this, he said,
would be to disobey the laws of his country<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>His private life was marked by a firm self-control. Athens
was now wealthy, and its leading citizens frequently gathered
together for festive purposes. Socrates joined them, but showed
the greatest moderation in eating and drinking: such a course,
he said, was the better for health and also produced more real
pleasure. Over the grosser temptations of the senses he had
won a complete victory<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. His temper was calm and even; he
was not put out by the violences of his wife, nor did he allow
himself to break out into rage with his slaves. His personal
habits, though simple, were careful: he did not approve any
neglect either of bodily cleanliness or of neatness in dress.</p>

<p>Thus Socrates gave an example of a life of activity and self-control
(ἰσχὺς καὶ κράτος); and by his character, even more than
by his speculation, exercised an influence which extended widely
over many centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His teaching.</div>

<p id="section45"><b>45.</b> The teaching of Socrates is not easily reduced to the
set formulae of a philosophic school. But clearly
it was focussed upon the life of men in the city
and in the home, and was no longer chiefly concerned with the
phenomena of the sky or the history of the creation of the
universe. So Cicero well says of him that ‘Socrates called
philosophy down from the heavens to earth, and introduced it
into the houses and cities of men, compelling men to enquire
concerning life and morals and things good and evil<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>’; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Seneca that he ‘recalled the whole of philosophy to moral
questions, and said that the supreme wisdom was to distinguish
between good and evil<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.’ He had no higher object than to send
out young men, of whose good disposition he was assured, to
take an active part in the affairs of the community, and to this
course he urged them individually and insistently<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. But it
must not be supposed that he put on one side problems concerned
with the acquirement of truth, or with the constitution
and government of the universe. His views on these points
carried perhaps all the more weight because they were stated
by him not as personal opinions, but as points upon which he
desired to share the convictions of his neighbours, if only they
could assure him that reason was on their side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reason the guide.</div>

<p id="section46"><b>46.</b> Socrates more than any other man possessed the art
of persuasive reasoning, thereby making his companions
wiser and better men. First he asked that
terms should be carefully defined, so that each man should know
what the nature is of each thing that exists<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, and should examine
himself and know well of what he speaks. Next he introduced
the practice of induction (ἐπακτικοὶ λόγοι), by which men make
larger the outlook of their minds, understand one thing by
comparison with another, and arrange the matter of their
thought by classes<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. By induction we arrive at general truths:
not however by any mechanical or mathematical process, but
(at least in the higher matters) by the use of Divination, that
is, by a kind of divine enlightenment<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. He who has accustomed
himself to think with deliberation, to look on the little in its
relation to the great, and to attune himself to the divine will,
goes out into the world strengthened in self-restraint, in argumentative
power, and in active goodwill to his fellow-men.</p>

<p>Most directly this method appeals to the future statesman.
Of those who seek the society of Socrates many intend to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
become generals or magistrates. Let them consider well what
these words mean. Is not a pilot one who knows how to steer
a ship? a cook one who knows how to prepare food? must we
not then say that a statesman is one who knows how to guide
the state? And how can he know this but by study and
training? Must we not then say generally that all arts depend
on knowledge, and knowledge on study? Do we not reach the
general truths that ‘virtue is knowledge’ and that ‘virtue can be
taught’? We may hesitate as to how to apply these principles
to our individual actions, and Socrates will accuse none on
this point; but for himself he has a divine monitor which never
fails to warn him when his mind is turned towards a course
which the gods disapprove.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His dualism in physics.</div>

<p id="section47"><b>47.</b> In the speculations of the Ionian philosophers Socrates
could find no satisfaction. But one day he discovered
with pleasure the words of Anaxagoras:
‘it is mind that orders the world and is cause of all things<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.’
Thus he was attracted to a dualistic view of the universe, in
which matter and mind are in fundamental contrast. In the
beginning there existed a chaos of unordered dead meaningless
matter, and also mind, the principle of life, meaning, and
order. Mind touched matter, and the universe sprang into
being. Mind controls matter, and thus the universe continues
to exist. The proof is found in the providential adaptation of
the world for the life and comfort of mankind: for it is only
consistent to suppose that things that exist for use are the work
of mind<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. He that made man gave him eyes to see with, ears
to hear with, and a mouth conveniently placed near to the
organs of sight and smell; he implanted in him a love of his
offspring, and in the offspring a love of its parents; and lastly
endowed him with a soul capable of understanding and worshipping
his maker. For the divine power Socrates uses quite
indifferently the words ‘god’ and ‘gods’: but his belief is
essentially monotheistic. In the gods of the city of Athens he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
has ceased to believe, although he still makes sacrifices upon
their altars in good-humoured conformity with the law, and
even adopts the popular term ‘divination<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,’ though in a sense
very different to that in which the official priesthood used it.</p>

<p>In the analysis of human nature Socrates adopts a similar
dualism. Man consists of body and soul: the soul is lord and
king over the body, and indeed may rightly be called divine, if
anything that has touch with humanity is such<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His pietism.</div>

<p id="section48"><b>48.</b> The practical teaching of Socrates was entirely dominated
by his religious principles. The gods, he
held, know all things, our words, our deeds, and the
secrets of our hearts: they are everywhere present and give
counsel to men concerning the whole of life<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. The first duty of
man is therefore to enter into communion with the gods by
prayer, asking them to give us the good and deliver us from the
evil, but not qualifying the prayer by any instruction to the gods
as to what is good or evil; for this the gods themselves know
best<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. In these words then we may pray: ‘Zeus our king, give
us what is good for us whether we ask for it or not; what is evil,
even though we ask for it in prayer, keep far from us<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.’</p>

<p>In this spirit of what we should to-day call ‘pietism’ we
must interpret his principle that ‘virtue is knowledge<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.’ This
not only asserts that no one can rightly practise any art unless
he has studied and understands it, but also that no one can
rightly understand an art without practising it. We say that
there are men who know what is good and right, but do not
perform it; but this is not so; for such men in truth think that
some other course is good for them. Only the wise and pious
man has a right understanding; others cannot do good even if
they try<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; and when they do evil, even that they do without
willing it<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p>In its application to politics the teaching of Socrates came
into collision with the democratic sentiments prevalent at Athens.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
To say the least, Socrates had no prejudice against the rule of
kings. He distinguished sharply between kingship and tyranny,
saying that the rule of one man with the assent of his subjects
and in accordance with the laws was kingship, but without such
assent and according to the man’s arbitrary will was tyranny. But
under whatever constitutional form government was carried on,
Socrates asserted that those who knew the business of government
were alone the true rulers, and that the will of the crowd,
if conflicting with that of the wise, was both foolish and
impious<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why Socrates was condemned.</div>

<p id="section49"><b>49.</b> So teaching and influencing men Socrates lived in
Athens till his seventieth year was past, and then
died by the hands of the public executioner. This
fate he might so easily have avoided that it seemed
almost to be self-chosen. His disciple Xenophon expresses
amazement that the jurors should have condemned a man so
modest and so wise, and so practical a benefactor of the
Athenian people<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. Modern historians, with a wider knowledge
of human nature, wonder rather that Socrates was allowed to
live so long<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. The accusers complained that Socrates offended
by disbelieving in the gods of the city, introducing new deities,
and corrupting the youth of Athens. From the point of view
of conservatively-minded Athenians, the charges were amply
justified. Clearly Socrates disbelieved, not merely in the official
gods of the city, but also in the deities it worshipped most
earnestly, democracy and empire. Not only did he introduce
new deities, but it might fairly be argued that he was introducing
the most essential parts of the religion of the national enemy,
Persia. Daily inculcating these heretical doctrines upon young
men of the highest families in Athens, he might well be the
cause that the Athenian state was less unquestioningly served than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
before. That the heresies of Socrates were soundly founded on
wide observation and general truths could not be considered to
make them less dangerous. Athens had already passed the
time when its political power could be of service to its neighbours;
it had not reached that when it could be content with
intellectual influence; Socrates, just because he was in harmony
with the future of Athens, was a discordant element in its
present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The companions of Socrates.</div>

<p id="section50"><b>50.</b> It is with difficulty, and not without the risk of error,
that we trace even in outline the positive teaching
of Socrates. The severe self-repression with which
he controlled his senses was exercised by him no
less over his intelligence. In his expositions it took the shape
of irony (εἰρωνεία), that is, the continual withholding of his
personal convictions, and obstetrics (μαιευτική), the readiness to
assist others in bringing their speculations to the birth. Thus
he was a great educator rather than a great teacher. For
whilst he held that virtue alone was worthy of investigation, and
that virtue was essentially wisdom, he professed to be entirely at
a loss where to find this wisdom for himself; he left it to his
pupils to go out and discover the precious cup. Thus whilst
men of all classes and with every variety of mental bias listened
to his teaching, not one was content with his negative attitude.
Of the various suggestions which Socrates threw out, without
committing himself to any one, his pupils took up each in turn
and endeavoured to construct out of it a system<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. These
systems were in the sharpest possible contrast one with another,
but they have certain points in common. All the teachers
retained a strong personal affection and loyalty towards their
common master; each was convinced that he alone possessed
the secret of his real convictions. All of them held aloof from
the physical speculations of which the ripe fruit was already
being gathered in by the Atomists. The portal of knowledge
was to all of them the right use of the reasoning power; the
shrine itself was the discipline of virtue, the attainment of happiness,
the perfect ordering of social life. Such were the Socratic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
schools, in which philosophy was now somewhat sharply divided
into the two branches of dialectics and ethics. Another century
had yet to elapse before the rejected discipline of physics again
established its importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cynics.</div>

<p id="section51"><b>51.</b> Of the Socratic schools three contributed directly to
the Stoic system. Of these the Cynic school,
founded by <span class="smcap">Antisthenes</span> of Athens (circ. 440-365
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and developed by <span class="smcap">Diogenes</span> of Sinope, is its immediate
precursor. The Cynic masters inherited most completely the
moral earnestness<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and the direct pietistic teaching of Socrates;
and for this reason Antisthenes appears to have been the
master’s favourite pupil. The lives both of these men and of
their successors were marked by simplicity and self-abnegation,
and they devoted themselves with true missionary zeal to the
reformation of moral outcasts. The caricature of the figure of
Diogenes which was promulgated by his opponents and still
lives in literary tradition needs constantly to be corrected by the
picture which Epictetus gives of him, and which (though not
without an element of idealization and hero-worship) shews us
the man as he appeared to his own disciples.</p>

<p>The breach with the state-religion which was latent in
Socrates was displayed without disguise by the Cynics. Antisthenes,
following in the track of the ardent Xenophanes,
declared that the popular gods were many, but the god of
nature was one<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>; he denounced the use of images<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>; and he
and his followers naturally acquired the reproach of atheism<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.
Equally offensive to the Athenians was their cosmopolitanism<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>,
which treated the pride of Hellenic birth as vain, and poured
contempt on the glorious victories of Marathon and Salamis.
Nor did the Cynics consider the civilization of their times as
merely indifferent; they treated it as the source of all social evils,
and looked for a remedy in the return to a ‘natural’ life, to
the supposed simplicity and virtue of the savage unspoilt by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
education. Thus they formulated a doctrine which especially
appealed to those who felt themselves simple and oppressed, and
which has been well described as ‘the philosophy of the proletariate
of the Greek world<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cynic intuitionism.</div>

<p id="section52"><b>52.</b> The destructive criticism of the Cynics did not stop
with its attack upon Greek institutions; it assailed
the citadel of reason itself. Socrates had renounced
physics; the Cynics considered that dialectic was equally unnecessary<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.
For the doctrine of general concepts and the exercise
of classification they saw no use; they were strict Nominalists;
horses they could see, but not ‘horsiness.’ In their ethics they
held to the chief doctrines of Socrates, that ‘virtue is knowledge,’
‘virtue can be taught’ and ‘no one willingly sins’; and they laid
special stress on the ‘sufficiency’ (αὐτάρκεια) of virtue, which to
produce happiness needs (according to them) nothing in addition
to itself except a Socratic strength of character (Σωκρατικὴ
ἰσχύς)<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. But in reality they identified virtue with this will-power,
and entirely dispensed with knowledge; virtue was to
them a matter of instinct, not of scientific investigation. They
appear therefore as the real founders of that ethical school
which bases knowledge of the good on intuition, and which is
at the present time, under ever-varying titles, the most influential
of all. In practice, the virtue which specially appealed
to the Cynics was that of ‘liberty,’ the claim of each man at
every moment to do and say that which seems to him right,
without regard to the will of sovereigns, the conventions of
society, or the feelings of his neighbour; the claim made at all
times by the governed against their rulers, whether these are
just or unjust, reckless or farseeing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Limits of Cynism.</div>

<p id="section53"><b>53.</b> Cynism is in morals what Atomism is in physics; a
doctrine which exercises a widespread influence
because of its extreme simplicity, which is extraordinarily
effective within the range of ideas to which it is
appropriate, and fatally mischievous outside that range. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
is more alien from Cynism than what we now call cynicism; the
Cynics were virtuous, warm-hearted, good-humoured, and pious.
In their willing self-abnegation they equalled or surpassed the
example set by Buddhist monks, but they were probably much
inferior to them in the appreciation of natural beauty and the
simple pleasures of life. As compared with their master Socrates,
they lacked his genial presence, literary taste, and kindly tolerance;
and they were intensely antipathetic to men of the type of
Plato and Aristotle, whose whole life was bound up with pride
in their country, their birth, and their literary studies<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Xenophon.</div>

<p id="section54"><b>54.</b> The Cynics themselves seem to have made no effective
use of literature to disseminate their views; but
in the works of <span class="smcap">Xenophon</span> of Athens (440-circ.
350 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) we have a picture of Socrates drawn almost exactly
from the Cynic standpoint. Xenophon was a close personal
friend of Antisthenes, and thoroughly shared his dislike for
intellectual subtleties. He was possessed of a taste for military
adventure, and his interpretation of Socratic teaching entirely
relieved him of any scruples which patriotism might have imposed
upon him in this direction, leaving him free at one time
to support the Persian prince Cyrus, and at another to join with
the Spartan king Agesilaus against his own countrymen. From
adventure he advanced to romance-writing, and his sketches of
the expedition of the Ten Thousand Greeks (in which he took
part in person) and of the life of Cyrus the Great have an
interest which in no way depends upon their accuracy. The
account which he gives of Socrates in his <i>Memorabilia</i> (ἀπομνημονεύματα)
is not always to be depended upon; it is at the best
a revelation of one side only of the historic philosopher; but it
is to a large extent confirmed by what we learn from other
sources, and is of special interest to us because of the great
influence it exercised over Latin literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cyrenaics.</div>

<p id="section55"><b>55.</b> In the opposite direction <span class="smcap">Aristippus</span> of Cyrene shared
the sympathetic tone of Socrates, but could not adopt
his moral earnestness or his zeal for the good of
others. He refused altogether the earnest appeal of Socrates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
that he should take part in politics. ‘It seems to me,’ he says,
‘to show much folly that a man who has quite enough to do to
find the necessities of life for himself, should not be satisfied with
this, but should take upon himself to provide his fellow-citizens
with all that they want, and to answer for his action in the courts
if he is not successful.’ Aristippus revolted altogether from the
ascetic form in which the Cynics represented his master’s
teaching, and held that the wise man, by self-restraint and
liberal training, attained to the truest pleasure, and that such
pleasure was the end of life. The Cyrenaics (as his followers
were called) were the precursors in ethics of the school of
Epicurus; and the bitter opposition which was later on to rage
between Stoics and Epicureans was anticipated by the conflict
between the Cynics and the Cyrenaics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Megarians.</div>

<p id="section56"><b>56.</b> The school of <span class="smcap">Euclides</span> of Megara swerved suddenly
from these ethical interests and devoted itself
mainly to the problems of dialectic. From the
Socratic practice of classification it arrived at the doctrine of
the One being, which alone it held to be truly existent, and
which it identified with the One God proclaimed by Xenophanes
and his followers of the Eleatic school. To the Megaric
school we are therefore chiefly indebted for the assertion of the
philosophical principle of monism; the same school drew the
necessary logical consequence, that evil is not in any real sense
existent. From the Eleatics the Megarians further derived an
interest in logical speculation of all kinds, and they were greatly
occupied with the solution of fallacies: amongst the followers of
this school we first meet with the puzzles of ‘the heap’ (<i>Sorites</i>),
‘the liar’ (<i>Pseudomenos</i>), and others upon which in later times
Chrysippus and other Stoics sharpened their wits<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. <span class="smcap">Diodorus</span>
the Megarian set out certain propositions with regard to the
relation of the possible and the necessary which are of critical
importance in connexion with the problem of free-will<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Finally
<span class="smcap">Stilpo</span>, who taught in Athens about 320 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and who made
a violent attack upon Plato’s theory of ideas, adopted an ethical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
standpoint not unlike that of the Cynics<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, and counted amongst
his pupils the future founder of Stoicism. Stilpo enjoyed
amongst his contemporaries a boundless reputation; princes and
peoples vied in doing him honour<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>; but we have scarcely any
record of his teaching, and know him almost exclusively as one
who contributed to form the mind of Zeno.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advance of Philosophy.</div>

<p id="section57"><b>57.</b> With the school founded by Phaedo of Elis we are not
concerned; the consideration of Plato and Aristotle
and their respective followers we must leave to
another chapter. We have already seen philosophy grow from
being the interest of isolated theorists into a force which is
gathering men in groups, and loosening the inherited bonds of
city and class. So far its course has violently oscillated, both as
regards its subject-matter and its principles. But its range is
now becoming better defined, and in the period that is approaching
we shall find determined attempts to reach a comprehensive
solution of the problems presented to enquiring minds.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97" class="label">[22]</a> The terms ‘monism’ and ‘dualism’ have recently become the watchwords of
opposing armies of popular philosophers, especially in Germany. In this book they
stand for two aspects of philosophical thought which are not necessarily irreconcileable.
For without such contrasts as life and matter, universe and individual, right and wrong,
thought is impossible; so far we are all ‘dualists.’ Yet as soon as we fix our
attention on these contrasts, we find that they are not final, but point towards some
kind of ultimate reconciliation; and to this extent all diligent thinkers tend to become
‘monists.’ Similarly the broad monistic principle ‘all things are one’ is meaningless
apart from some kind of interpretation in dualistic language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political changes of the 4th century.</div>

<p id="section58"><b>58.</b> Before a hundred years had passed since the death
of Socrates, the face of the Greek world had been
completely changed. Athens, Lacedaemon, Corinth,
Thebes, which had been great powers, had sunk
into comparative insignificance; their preeminence was gone,
and even of their independence but little remained. Throughout
Greece proper the Macedonian was master. But if the old-fashioned
politician suffered a bitter disappointment, and the
adherents of the old polytheism despaired of the future, there
was rich compensation for the young and the hopeful. Petty
wars between neighbouring cities, with their wearisome refrain
‘and the men they killed, and the women and children they
enslaved<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,’ began to be less common; internal and still more
murderous strife between bigoted oligarchs or democrats began
to be checked from without. For the enlightened Greek a new
world of enterprise had been opened up in the East. Alexander
the Great had not only conquered Asia Minor, and established
everywhere the Greek language and a Greek bureaucracy; he
had opened the way to the far East, and pointed out India and
even China as fields for the merchant and the colonizer. His
work had been partly frustrated by the disorders that followed
his death; but if achievement was thus hindered, hopes were not
so quickly extinguished. These new hopes were not likely to
be accompanied by any lasting regrets for the disappearance
of ancient systems of government now regarded as effete or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
ridiculous, or of inherited mythologies which were at every point
in conflict with the moral sense<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">East and West.</div>

<p id="section59"><b>59.</b> The same historic events which opened the East to
Hellenic adventurers also made the way into
Europe easy for the Oriental. As the soldier and
the administrator travelled eastward, so the merchant and the
philosopher pushed his way to the West. Not merely in Persia
had ancient superstitions been swept away by reforming zeal;
the Jews were now spreading from town to town the enthusiasm
of a universalized religion which was ridding itself of bloody
sacrifices; and, for the time at least, the humane philosophy of
the Buddha was dominant in India, was being preached far and
wide by self-sacrificing monks, and was inspiring the policy of
great monarchies. We find it hard to picture the clashing of
ideals, enthusiasms, and ambitions which was at this time taking
place in all the great cities of the old world; but it is certain
that in the universal excitement the old distinctions of Greek
and barbarian, Jew and Gentile, rich and poor, free and slave,
man and woman were everywhere becoming weakened, and
community of thought and temperament were beginning to
reunite on a new basis individuals who had broken loose from
the ties of ancient society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New schools of philosophy.</div>

<p id="section60"><b>60.</b> During this fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the foundations were
laid of the four philosophical schools which were
destined to vie one with another for the allegiance
of the Roman world. The Socratic schools which we have
already mentioned, those of the Cynics and Cyrenaics, did not
perhaps altogether die out; in particular the Cynic missionaries
appear to have been a social force until the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
But their intellectual basis was too narrow to admit of their
effective transplantation to new soil. At the end of the century
each gave place to a new school, which preserved the central
doctrines of its predecessor. The Socratic paradoxes were
handed on from the Cynics to the Stoics; the doctrine that
pleasure is the good was accepted by Epicurus. Stoics and
Epicureans disputed with a bitterness as yet unequalled, finding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
themselves just as much opposed upon the subjects of logic and
physics, which they introduced anew into popular philosophy, as
upon the questions of ethics on which their antipathies were
inherited. Between them stood two schools which had meanwhile
established themselves. Plato, himself a companion of
Socrates, founded the Academy at Athens about 380 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; and
if he did not impress his own teaching upon it with absolute
fixity, still the school flourished under a succession of leaders,
always proud of the fame of its founder, and rendering him at
least a nominal allegiance. From the Academy branched off
the school of the Peripatetics, founded by Plato’s pupil Aristotle
about 350 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> After Aristotle’s death this school gravitated
towards the Academics, and in later centuries there seemed little
difference, if any, between the two. If Stoicism may be called
the child of Cynism, it largely drew nourishment from these two
schools and their founders. Some account of the teaching of
Plato and Aristotle is therefore needed here, partly because of
the great importance of both in the general history of philosophy,
partly because of their direct influence upon the subject of this
book. On account of the much greater prominence of the
Academy in the later history we shall often use this term to refer
to the general teaching of the two allied schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato.</div>

<p id="section61"><b>61.</b> Of all the companions of Socrates far the most famous
is <span class="smcap">Plato</span> of Athens (427-347 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), the founder
of the philosophical association known as the
‘Academy.’ In the general judgment of lovers of Greek letters
he stands out not merely as a great master of Attic prose style,
but also as the ablest exponent of the true mind of Socrates<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,
and the most brilliant light of Greek philosophy<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. On the
first point this judgment stands unchallenged; for delicate and
good-natured wit, felicity of illustration and suggestiveness of
thought the Platonic dialogues are unrivalled. But it is only
in his earlier writings that we can accept Plato as a representative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
of Socrates; after the death of his master he travelled
for many years in Egypt, Lower Italy, and Sicily, and absorbed
in particular much of the teaching of the Pythagoreans. The
theory of ‘ideas,’ the special characteristic of Plato’s later work,
is not strictly Socratic. Neither, we must add, is it of first-rate
importance in the history of human thought; from our
point of view it lies apart from the main current both of speculation
and of practice. It was a still-born theory, not accepted
even by Plato’s successors in the control of the Academy<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. We
are therefore very little concerned with the direct teaching of
Plato; but all the more readily it should be acknowledged that
the Stoics were often indebted to him for help in the treatment
of important details, and that the Platonic attitude remained
for them a factor of which they needed continuously to take
account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plato’s realism.</div>

<p id="section62"><b>62.</b> A striking feature of the Platonic dialogues is that their
results are usually negative. First the opinions of
the crowd, then those of Socrates’ contemporaries
the ‘sophists’ and of the other Socratic schools are subjected
to a cross-examination, under which they are one and all
shewn to be unreasonable. This cross-examination is quite in
the Socratic spirit, and is before all things a mental gymnastic,
training the dialectician to observe with keener eye and to
discuss with apter tongue than his fellows. Gradually there
emerges from a mass of doubts something like a positive theory
that Plato is prepared to adopt. The true reasoning is that of
induction from the particular to the general, from the individual
to the class. In the class name we come upon the true being of
the individual, and by a right definition of it we discern what
each thing really is. The ‘idea,’ which corresponds to the class
name, is alone really existent; the individual is a more or less
imperfect imitation of it (μίμησις). In this way Plato found
what seemed to him a solution of a difficulty which Socrates
hardly felt, that of explaining the participation (μέθεξις) of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the particular in the general (ὑπόθεσις or ἰδέα). Thus where
ordinary men see ‘horses,’ and Antisthenes holds that they are
right, Plato sees ‘horsiness,’ or the idea of ‘horse.’ In the
language of medieval philosophy Plato is a <i>realist</i>, that is, one
who holds that our Ideas are more than what men mean when
they say ‘mere ideas’; that they are Realities, and have their
being in a truly existing world; and that in knowing them we
know what <i>is</i>. But just as Plato holds that general conceptions
are alone true and real, so he necessarily maintains that objects
perceivable by the senses are only half-real, and that the ordinary
man lives in a world of illusions. Thus the thoughts of the
philosopher are separated by an abyss from the world in which
men live and die.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God and the soul.</div>

<p id="section63"><b>63.</b> Upon the basis of the individual ‘ideas’ Plato builds up
by a process of classification and induction higher
and smaller classes of ideas, until we begin to see
the vision of a single idea, a class which includes all classes, a
supreme ‘being’ from which all being is derived. This highest
idea is variously suggested by the names ‘the Good,’ ‘the
Beautiful,’ ‘the One.’ By a sudden transformation it becomes
the Creator (δημιουργός) of the universe. Containing in itself
all being, it needs for its operation some kind of formless and
inert matter; for this the name ἄπειρον, ‘the unlimited,’ is taken
from Anaximander. The whole created universe may be considered
as the joint production of the ‘idea’ and the ‘unlimited’;
and the cosmology of Anaxagoras, ‘all things were together,
and mind came and ordered them,’ is substantially justified.
The world thus created is both good and beautiful, for it is made
by a good Creator on the best of patterns.</p>

<p>The human soul is of triple nature. The highest part, the
rational soul (τὸ λογιστικόν), is seated in the head; the emotional
soul (τὸ θυμοειδές) in the heart; the appetitive soul (τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν)
in the belly. Over these two lower souls the reasoning
part should hold control, as a driver over two unruly steeds<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
The rational soul has existed before birth, and may hope for
immortality, for it is knit up with the idea of ‘being.’ Ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
it may even attain to perfection, if it is purified as by fire from
baser elements that have attached themselves to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethics and Politics.</div>

<p id="section64"><b>64.</b> Plato himself does not formulate an ethical ideal of the
same precision that his successors used, but we infer
from his works a goal towards which he points.
Thus the ethical end for each man is the greatest possible
participation in the idea of the good, the closest attainable
imitation of the deity. The virtue of each part of the human
soul lies in the fit performance of its proper work; that of the
reasoning soul is Wisdom (σοφία); of the emotional soul
Courage (ἀνδρεία); of the appetitive soul Soberness (σοφροσύνη).
Over all (it is hinted rather than stated) rules the
supreme virtue of Justice (δικαιοσύνη), assigning to each part
its proper function. Thus the four cardinal virtues are deduced
as a practical application from the Platonic psychology. The
high position assigned to Justice leads up to the practical
doctrine of Moderation (μετριότης); even the virtues are
restricted both in their intensity and in their spheres of work,
and if any virtue passes its proper limit it becomes changed into
the vice that borders on it. Thus the ideal of practical life
is the ‘moderate man,’ calm, considerate, and self-respecting,
touched with a warm flow of feeling, but never carried away
into excitement; and even this ideal is strictly subordinate to
that of the life of philosophic contemplation.</p>

<p>The ideal State is modelled on the individual man. To the
three parts of the soul correspond three classes of citizens; the
rulers, whose virtue is Wisdom; the guardians, on whom
Courage is incumbent; the labourers and tradesmen, who owe
the State Soberness and obedience. Thus the political system
to which Plato leans is that of an Aristocracy; for the middle
class in his state has only an executive part in the government,
and the lower orders are entirely excluded from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle.</div>

<p id="section65"><b>65.</b> By far the greatest of Plato’s pupils was <span class="smcap">Aristotle</span> of
Stagira (384-322 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), who introduced into philosophy,
now convulsed by the disputes of the
disciples of Socrates, a spirit of reconciliation. From his point
of view the various contentions are not so much erroneous as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
defective. To attain the truth we need first to collect the
various opinions that are commonly held, and then to seek the
reconciling formula of which each one is a partial statement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ten categories.</div>

<p id="section66"><b>66.</b> In his investigation Aristotle did not altogether break
with Plato’s theory of ideas, but brought them
from a transcendental world into touch with common
life. He held fast to the method of induction (ἐπαγωγή) from
the particular to the general, and agreed that we reach the true
nature of each thing when we have determined the class-conception.
But the class-conception or idea (ἰδέα), though the
most real existence, does not exist independently, but only
in and through the particulars, which compose the class.
Having thus come to see that there are gradations of existence,
we need to inquire what these are; and to classify the various
kinds of judgment with regard to which we inquire whether they
are true or false. Now by observation we find that judgments
or predications have ten different shapes, to which therefore
there must correspond ten kinds of existence. These are the
well-known ‘categories’ of Aristotle, and are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>(i) ‘substance,’ as when we say ‘this is a man,’ ‘a horse’;</li>
<li>(ii) ‘quantity,’ as that he is ‘six feet high’;</li>
<li>(iii) ‘quality,’ as ‘a grammarian’;</li>
<li>(iv) ‘relation,’ as ‘twice as much’;</li>
<li>(v) ‘place,’ as ‘at Athens’;</li>
<li>(vi) ‘time,’ as ‘last year’;</li>
<li>(vii) ‘position,’ as ‘lying down’;</li>
<li>(viii) ‘possession,’ as ‘with a sword’;</li>
<li>(ix) ‘action,’ as ‘cuts’; and</li>
<li>(x) ‘passion,’ as ‘is cut’ or ‘is burned.’</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Aristotle thus reinstates the credit of the common man; he it is
who possesses the substance of truth and gives it habitual expression
by speech, even roughly indicating the various kinds of
existence by different forms of words. It is now indicated that
a study of grammar is required as the foundation of logic.</p>

<p>Aristotle also greatly advanced the study of that kind of
reasoning which proceeds from the general to the particular, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
which is best expressed in terms of the ‘syllogism’ (συλλογισμός),
of which he defined the various forms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The four causes.</div>

<p id="section67"><b>67.</b> In the study of physics Aristotle picks up the thread
which Socrates had dropped deliberately, that is,
the teaching of the Ionic philosophers. Either
directly from Empedocles, or from a <i>consensus</i> of opinion now
fairly established, he accepted the doctrine of the four elements
(στοιχεῖα), earth, water, air, and fire; but to these he added a
fifth (πεμπτὸν στοιχεῖον, <i>quinta essentia</i>), the aether, which fills
the celestial spaces. Behind this analysis lies the more important
problem of cosmology, the question how this world comes to be.
Collecting once more the opinions commonly held, Aristotle
concludes that four questions are usually asked, and that in them
the search is being made for four ‘causes,’ which will solve the
respective questions. The four causes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>(i) the Creator, or ‘efficient cause,’ answering the question;—Who made the world?</li>
<li>(ii) the Substance, or ‘material cause’;—of what did he make it?</li>
<li>(iii) the Plan, or ‘modal cause’;—according to what design?</li>
<li>(iv) the End, or ‘final cause’;—for what purpose?<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Reviewing these ‘causes’ Aristotle concludes that the first, third,
and fourth are ultimately one, the Creator containing in his own
nature both the plan and the purpose of his work<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. The solution
is therefore dualistic, and agrees substantially with that of Plato;
the ultimate existences are (i) an informing power, and (ii) matter
that has the potentiality of accepting form.</p>

<p>In consequence of this dualism of Aristotle the term ‘matter’
(ὕλη, <i>materia</i>) has ever since possessed associations which did
not belong to it in the time of the hylozoists. Matter now
begins to suggest something lifeless, inert, and unintelligent;
and to be sharply contrasted not only with such conceptions as
‘God’ and ‘mind,’ but also with motion and force. For this
reason the Stoics in reintroducing monism preferred a new term,
as we shall see below<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The microcosm.</div>

<p id="section68"><b>68.</b> What God is to the universe, that the soul is to the
body, which is a ‘little universe<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.’ But the reasoning
part of the soul only is entirely distinct; this
is of divine nature, and has entered the body from without; it is
at once its formative principle, its plan, and its end. The lower
parts of the soul are knit up with the body, and must perish with
it. So far Aristotle’s teaching differs little from that of Plato;
but a new point of view is introduced when he speaks of the
soul as subject to ‘diseases’ (παθήματα), and thus assigns to the
practical philosopher a social function as the comrade of the
physician. Amongst the diseases he specially names Pity and
Fear, which assail the emotional part of the soul. Their cure is
found in ‘purging’ (κάθαρσις), that is to say in their complete
expulsion from the soul, as reason and circumstances may
require; but Aristotle by no means considers that the analogy
between body and soul is complete, or that the emotions should
always be regarded as injurious<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethics and Politics.</div>

<p id="section69"><b>69.</b> In setting forth an ideal for human activity Aristotle
conceives that other philosophers have differed
more in words than in substance, and he hopes
to reconcile them through the new term ‘blessedness’ (εὐδαιμονία).
This blessedness is attained when the soul is
actively employed in a virtuous way, and when it is so circumstanced
that it commands the instruments of such action,
that is, in a life which is adequately furnished. On such activity
pleasure must assuredly attend, and it is therefore needless to
seek it of set purpose. Further, virtue appears personified in
the ‘true gentleman’ (καλὸς κἀγαθός), who ever avoids vicious
extremes, and finds his highest satisfaction in pure contemplation,
just as the Creator himself lives to contemplate the world he has
produced<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>In politics Aristotle can find ground for approving in turn of
monarchy, oligarchy, and democracy, according to the circumstances
of each state. We cannot however but feel that his
sympathies point most towards monarchy, and that his personal
association with Alexander the Great was in full harmony with
his inmost convictions. As a means of government he advocates
before all things the education of the young.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social prepossessions.</div>

<p id="section70"><b>70.</b> The philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, comprehensive
in their range, brilliant and varied in their
colouring, nevertheless appeal effectively only to
a limited circle. Socrates had been the companion of rich
and poor alike; Plato and Aristotle addressed themselves to
men of wealth, position, and taste. Their sympathies appear
clearly in their political systems, in which the sovereign or the
aristocracy is considered fit to play a part, whilst the many are
practically excluded from the commonwealth, sometimes as a
harmless flock which needs kindly shepherding, and at other times
as a dangerous crowd which must be deceived or enslaved for
its own good. These prepossessions, which we shall find
reappearing within the Stoic system, appear to weaken the
practical forcefulness of both philosophies. In the ideal
character the Socratic ‘force’ has disappeared, and ‘self-restraint’
alone is the standard of virtue; the just man moves
quietly and conventionally through life, perhaps escaping blame,
but hardly achieving distinction. In resuming the study of
ontology, which Socrates had treated as a ‘mist from Ionia,’
bright fancies had been elaborated rather than dominating
conceptions; the deity of Aristotle seems but a faint reflex of
the god of Socrates and the Cynics, and neither the ‘idea’ of
Plato or the ‘matter’ of Aristotle is so well fitted for the world’s
hard work as the atoms of Leucippus and Democritus. The
teachers who succeeded to the control of the two schools inclined
more and more to engross themselves in special studies, and to
leave on one side the great controversial problems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Academics.</div>

<p id="section71"><b>71.</b> The followers of Plato were known as the ‘Academics’:
amongst them we must distinguish between the
members of the ‘old Academy,’ as Cicero terms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
them<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, and those who followed the innovations of Arcesilaus.
The old Academy chiefly developed the ethical side of Plato’s
teaching, finding that the path of virtue is indicated by
the natural capacities of the individual. Thus <span class="smcap">Xenocrates</span>
of Chalcedon (396-314 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) taught that each man’s happiness
resulted from the virtue proper to him (οἰκεία ἀρετή)<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; whilst
<span class="smcap">Polemo</span> of Athens (head of the school 314-270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) is said by
Cicero to have defined it as consisting in ‘virtuous living, aided
by those advantages to which nature first draws us,’ thereby
practically adopting the standard of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The teaching
of Polemo had a direct influence upon that of Zeno the founder
of Stoicism.</p>

<p>But with the first successes of Stoicism the Academy revived
its dialectical position, in strong opposition to the dogmatism of
the new school. <span class="smcap">Arcesilaus</span> of Pitane in Aeolia (315-240 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
revived the Socratic cross-examination, always opposing himself
to any theory that might be propounded to him, and drawing
the conclusion that truth could never be certainly known<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.
Life must therefore be guided by considerations of probability,
and the ethical standard is that ‘of which a reasonable defence
may be made<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.’ This sceptical attitude was carried still further
by <span class="smcap">Carneades</span> of Cyrene (214-129 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), whose acute criticism
told upon the Stoic leaders of his time, and forced them to
abandon some of their most important positions. From this
time a reconciliation between the two schools set in<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Peripatetics.</div>

<p id="section72"><b>72.</b> The members of the Peripatetic school founded by
Aristotle are of less importance to us. The
Romans found little difference between their teaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and that of the earlier Academy. Cicero mentions that
the Stoic Panaetius was a keen student of two of the pupils
of Aristotle, <span class="smcap">Theophrastus</span> (his successor as head of the
Peripatetic school) and <span class="smcap">Dicaearchus</span><a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; amongst later teachers
in whose views he is interested he names <span class="smcap">Hieronymus</span>,
who held that the supreme good was freedom from pain<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>;
<span class="smcap">Callipho</span>, who combined virtue with pleasure, and <span class="smcap">Diodorus</span>
who combined it with freedom from pain<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; and amongst his
contemporaries <span class="smcap">Staseas</span> of Naples, who stated the same
doctrines in a slightly different form<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, and <span class="smcap">Cratippus</span>, whom
he selected as a teacher for his own son<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. It was a common
complaint of these teachers that the Stoics had stolen their
doctrines wholesale, and (as is the way with thieves) had altered
the names only<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. All these writers however agree in denying
the doctrine which Zeno accepted from the Cynics that ‘virtue
is sufficient for happiness,’ and lay stress upon the supply of
external goods (χορηγία) as needed to admit of the active
exercise of virtue. They were diligent students of the written
works of their founder, and thus opened the way for the work
of erudition and interpretation which found its centre in
Alexandria in a later period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno.</div>

<p id="section73"><b>73.</b> Amidst the conflict of these schools <span class="smcap">Zeno</span> grew up.
Born in Citium on the island of Cyprus in 336 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
in the same year in which Alexander became
king of Macedon, he heard as a boy of the Greek conquest of
the East, and was only 13 years of age when its course was
checked by the death of Alexander. Of the town of Citium the
inhabitants were partly Greek, partly Phoenician; and Zeno,
whether or not he was of Phoenician blood, certainly derived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
from his environment something of the character of the enterprising
and much-travelled Phoenician nation, and imparted
this trait to the school which he founded. He was nicknamed
by his contemporaries ‘the Phoenician,’ and the title clung to
his followers<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. His father was a merchant of purple, and often
travelled in the one direction to Tyre and Sidon, in the other as
far as Athens, whence he brought back a number of ‘Socratic
books,’ which were eagerly read by the young Zeno, and in
time attracted him to the famous Greek city<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. We may presume
that when he first came to Athens he intended to carry
further his studies without abandoning his calling; but when
news reached him of the wreck of the ship which carried all his
goods, he welcomed it as a call to devote himself entirely to
philosophy<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. His first step in Athens was to seek out the man
who best represented the character of Socrates, as represented
in Xenophon’s Memoirs; and it is said that a bookseller accordingly
pointed him to <span class="smcap">Crates</span> of Thebes<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, the pupil and (it
would seem) the successor of Diogenes as acknowledged head
of the Cynic school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno joins the Cynics.</div>

<p id="section74"><b>74.</b> Our authorities busy themselves chiefly with narrating
the eccentricities of Crates, who wore warm clothing
in summer and rags in winter, entered the theatre
as the audience were coming out, and drank water instead of
wine. But doubtless, like his predecessors in the Cynic school,
he was a man of the true Socratic character, who had trained
himself to bear hunger and thirst, heat and cold, flattery and
abuse. His life and wisdom won him the love of the high-born
Hipparchia, who turned from her wealthy and noble suitors,
choosing instead the poverty of Crates, who had abandoned all
his possessions. In his company she went from house to house,
knocking at all doors in turn, sometimes admonishing the inmates
of their sins, sometimes sharing with them their meals<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
In such a life Zeno recognised the forcefulness of Socrates, and
in the dogmas of the Cynic school he reached the foundation on
which that life was built. From that foundation neither Zeno
nor his true followers ever departed, and thus Stoicism embodied
and spread the fundamental dogmas of Cynism, that the individual
alone is really existent, that virtue is the supreme good,
and that the wise man, though a beggar, is truly a king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno’s Republic.</div>

<p id="section75"><b>75.</b> Whilst still an adherent of the Cynic school<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, Zeno
wrote his Πολιτεία or <i>Republic</i>, which is evidently
an attack on Plato’s work with the same title<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. If
this work does not reveal to us the fully developed philosopher,
it at least shews us better than any other evidence what the man
Zeno was. His ideal was the establishment of a perfect State, a
completion of the work in which Alexander had failed; and he
found a starting-point in a treatise by Antisthenes on the same
subject. The ideal State must embrace the whole world, so that
a man no longer says, ‘I am of Athens,’ or ‘of Sidon,’ but ‘I
am a citizen of the world<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.’ Its laws must be those which are
prescribed by nature, not by convention. It will have no images
or temples, for these are unworthy of the nature of the deity; no
sacrifices, because he cannot be pleased by costly gifts; no law-courts,
for its citizens will do one another no harm; no statues,
for the virtues of its inhabitants will be its adornment<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; no
gymnasia, for its youth must not waste their time in idle
exercises<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p>The people will not be divided into classes (and here Plato’s
<i>Republic</i> is contradicted), for all alike will be wise men<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; nor
will men and women be clothed differently, or shamefacedly hide
any part of their bodies<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. No man will speak of a woman as
his property, for women will belong to the community only<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
As for the dead, men will not trouble whether they bury them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
(as the Greeks), burn them (as the Indians), or give them to the
birds (as the Persians); for it matters not at all what happens to
men’s dead bodies<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, but whether their souls shall reach the
abodes of the blest, or need hereafter to be purged by fire from
the foulness they have contracted through contact with the body<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
To conclude, Love shall be master throughout the State, being
as it were a God cooperating for the good of the whole<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>; and
the wise man shall be a citizen in it, not a missionary, and shall
be surrounded with wife and children<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno seeks knowledge.</div>

<p id="section76"><b>76.</b> Zeno, after writing his <i>Republic</i>, took up a position more
independent of the Cynics. He could not, perhaps,
avoid noticing that the coming of his model Kingdom
was hindered by the narrowmindedness of the philosophers,
their disagreement one with another, and their lack of clear
proofs for their dogmas. He began to realize that the study of
dialectics and physics was of more importance than his Cynic
teachers would allow; and he seems to have conceived the idea
of uniting the Socratic schools. He became eager to learn from
all sources, and turned first to Stilpo, who then represented the
Megarian school<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. Crates, we are told, tried to drag him back
from Stilpo by force; to which Zeno retorted that argument
would be more to the point<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. From this time he no longer
restricted his outlook to force of character, but sought also for
argumentative power and well ascertained knowledge. The
foundations of his state must be surely laid, not upon the
changing tide of opinion, but on the rock of knowledge. That
a wise man should hesitate, change his views, withdraw his
advice, he felt would be a bitter reproach<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. If indeed virtue,
the supreme good, is knowledge, must it not follow that knowledge
is within the reach of man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno’s theory of knowledge.</div>

<p id="section77"><b>77.</b> The chief cause of error, Zeno found, lay in hasty
assertion; and this he held was a fault not so much
of the intellect as of the will. In the simplest case
the senses present to the mind a ‘picture’ (φαντασία, <i>visum</i>),
carrying with it the suggestion of a statement (e.g. ‘that is a
horse’). But it is for the man to consider well whether this
suggestion is true, and only to give his ‘assent’ (συγκατάθεσις,
<i>adsensus</i>) when he is so assured. Assent is an act of the will,
and therefore in our power. Of a picture to which he has given
his assent the wise man should retain a firm hold; it then
becomes an item of ‘comprehension’ (φαντασία καταληπτική,
<i>comprehensio</i>), and may be stored in the memory, thus preparing
the way for further acquisitions of knowledge, which in the end
combine in ‘scientific knowledge’ (ἐπιστήμη, <i>scientia</i>).</p>

<p>This theory is little more than an exhortation against the
prevailing error of hasty thought (δόξα, <i>opinio</i>); but it made a
very deep impression, especially as enforced by Zeno’s gestures.
He stretched out his fingers and shewed the open palm, saying
‘Such is a picture.’ He partially contracted his fingers, and
said ‘This is assent.’ Making a closed fist, he said ‘This is
comprehension.’ Then closing in the left hand over the right
he pressed his fist tight, and said ‘This is science, and only the
wise man can attain to it<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.’</p>

<p>We have no reason to suppose that this theory was in any
way suggested by Stilpo, from whom however Zeno probably
learnt to attach importance to the formal part of reasoning,
such as ‘definition’ and the use of the syllogism. With Stilpo he
shared an aversion to the Platonic theory of ideas, maintaining
that ideas are by no means realities but have only a ‘kind of
existence’ in our minds, or (as we should call it to-day) a
‘subjective existence<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno studies under Polemo.</div>

<p id="section78"><b>78.</b> In becoming in turn a listener to Polemo, Zeno, we
may imagine, entered a new world. He left behind
the rough manners, the stinging retorts, and the
narrow culture of the Cynics and Eristics<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, to sit
with other intelligent students<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> at the feet of a man of cultured
manners<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and wide reading, who to a love for Homer and
Sophocles<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> had, we must suppose, added an intimate knowledge
of the works of Plato and Aristotle, was himself a great writer<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>,
and yet consistently taught that not learning, but a natural and
healthy life was the end to be attained. That Zeno profited
much from his studies under Polemo we may conjecture from
Polemo’s good-natured complaint, ‘I see well what you are
after: you break down my garden wall and steal my teaching,
which you dress in Phoenician clothes<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.’ From this time it
became a conventional complaint that Stoic doctrine was stolen
from that of the Academics: yet the sharp conflict between the
two schools shews that this cannot apply to essentials. But in
two important matters at least Zeno must have been indebted
to Academic teaching. This school had elaborated the doctrine
of Anaxagoras, which so attracted Socrates, that the world
began with the working of mind upon unordered matter. So
too, according to all our authorities, Zeno taught that there are
two beginnings, the active which is identified with the deity or
Logos, and the passive which is inert matter, or substance
without quality<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. This doctrine appears to pledge Zeno to a
dualistic view of the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Soul is body.’</div>

<p id="section79"><b>79.</b> On the other hand the Platonic teaching on the soul
was reversed by Zeno. He denied the opposition
between soul and body. ‘Soul is Breath<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>,’ he
taught, and ‘soul is body<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.’ With Plato’s threefold division
of the soul he would have nothing to do; rather he maintained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
that the soul has eight parts<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, each displaying itself in a distinct
power or capacity, whilst all of them are qualities or operations
of one soul in various relations<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. In this part of his philosophy
Zeno appears as a strong monist, and his debt to the Platonists
is necessarily restricted to details.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno studies Heraclitus.</div>

<p id="section80"><b>80.</b> It would seem then that Zeno after seeking for philosophic
safety for some twenty years in one harbour
after another had so far made shipwreck. But
from this shipwreck of his intellectual hopes he could afterwards
count the beginning of a fair voyage<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. As he eagerly discussed
with his younger fellow-student Arcesilaus the teaching of their
master Polemon, he took courage to point out its weak points<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>,
and began to quote in his own defence not only his previous
teachers Crates and Stilpo, but also the works of Heraclitus<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.
He thus broke down the barrier which Socrates had set up
against the Ionic philosophers. From Heraclitus Zeno drew
two doctrines of first-rate importance; the first, that of the
eternal fire<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and its mutation into the elements in turn<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; the
second (already referred to) that of the <i>Logos</i><a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. It is evident
that the Heraclitean doctrine of fire breaks down the distinction
between God and the world, active and passive, soul and body;
and is therefore inconsistent with the dualism which Zeno had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
partly borrowed from Plato. It is not clear whether Zeno
attained to clearness on this point; but in the general teaching
of the Stoics the monistic doctrine prevailed<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Hence God is
not separate from body, but is himself body in its purest form<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.
The <i>Logos</i> or divine reason is the power which pervades and
gives shape to the universe<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; and this Logos is identical with
the deity, that is with the primitive and creative Fire<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. The
Logos (ὀρθὸς λόγος, <i>vera ratio</i>) brings into harmony the parts of
philosophy; for it is also on the one hand the guide to right
reasoning<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; on the other hand the law which prescribes what is
right for the State and for the individual<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno opens his school.</div>

<p id="section81"><b>81.</b> When Zeno definitely accepted the teaching of Heraclitus,
he felt bound to break finally with the
school of Polemo, and he founded soon after
300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> a school of his own, which was rapidly crowded.
His followers were at first called Zenonians, but afterwards
Stoics, from the ‘picture porch’ (so called because it was
decorated with paintings by Polygnotus) in which he delivered
his lectures. He now applied himself afresh to the problem of
ethics. Whilst still adhering to the Cynic views that ‘virtue is
the only good,’ and that ‘example is more potent than precept,’
he entirely rejected the intuitional basis which the Cynics had
accepted, deciding in favour of the claims of reason. He found
his ideal in ‘consistency’ (ὁμολογία, <i>convenientia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; as the Logos
or Word rules in the universe, so should it also in the individual.
Those who live by a single and harmonious principle possess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
divine favour and an even flow of life<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>; those that follow conflicting
practices are ill-starred<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. In this consistency there is
found virtue, and (here again he follows the Cynics) virtue is
sufficient for happiness<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, and has no need of any external
support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His theory of virtue.</div>

<p id="section82"><b>82.</b> But whilst the virtue of the Cynics is something detached
and self-contained, and is ‘natural’ only
in the sense that it is not determined by custom
or authority, that of Zeno is bound up with the whole scheme
of the universe. For the universe puts before men certain
things, which though rightly named ‘indifferent’ by the Cynics,
and wrongly named ‘good’ by the Academics, have yet a certain
value (ἀξία, <i>aestimatio</i>), and are a natural goal for men’s actions<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.
Such are health, prosperity, good name, and other things which
the Academics named ‘things according to nature’ (τὰ κατὰ
φύσιν). These Zeno took over, not as a part of his theory of
virtue, but as the basis of it<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>; and for things having value
introduced the term ‘of high degree’ (προηγμένα), and for their
opposites the term ‘of low degree’ (ἀποπροηγμένα), these terms
being borrowed from court life. Thus virtue alone is queen,
and all things naturally desired are subject to her command<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
The end of life is therefore to live consistently, keeping in view
the aims set before us by nature, or shortly, to live ‘consistently
with nature.’ Our authorities do not agree as to whether Zeno
or Cleanthes was the first to use this phrase<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>; but there can be
no doubt that the doctrine is that of Zeno, that it is a fundamental
part of the Stoic system, and that it was maintained
unaltered by all orthodox Stoics. On the other hand the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Academics and Peripatetics ridiculed these new and barbarous
terms προηγμένα and ἀποπροηγμένα, and their view has generally
been supported both in ancient and modern times<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. We cannot
however question the right of Zeno to reserve a special term for
that which is morally good; he was in fact feeling his way
towards the position, still imperfectly recognized, that the
language of common life is inadequate to the exact expression
of philosophic principles<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno’s syllogisms.</div>

<p id="section83"><b>83.</b> In expounding his system Zeno made much use of the
syllogism, thereby laying the foundations of a new
style of oratory, consisting of short and pointed
clauses, which became a characteristic of his school<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. He no
doubt regarded this form as a sure method of attaining truth;
but even at the present day the principle that truth can only be
reached from facts and not from words is not everywhere admitted.
The syllogisms of Zeno have all their weak points, and
as a rule the term which is common to the major and minor
premisses suffers a shift of meaning. These syllogisms can
no longer convince us, and even in antiquity they were severely
criticized. But they are excellent aids to the memory, and so
serve the same end as the catechisms of the Reformation period.
Amongst the syllogisms attributed to Zeno are these: ‘That
which has reason is better than that which has not reason; but
nothing is better than the universe; therefore the universe has
reason<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.’ ‘No one trusts a secret to a drunken man; but one
trusts a secret to a good man; therefore a good man will not be
drunken<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.’ ‘No evil is accompanied by glory; but death is
accompanied by glory; therefore death is no evil<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.’ Such
syllogisms were embedded in the numerous works of Zeno, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
which many were certainly extant as late as the time of
Epictetus<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Epicurus and Arcesilaus.</div>

<p id="section84"><b>84.</b> At the very time when Zeno was elaborating the
doctrines of the Porch, another school of equal
eminence was established at Athens by <span class="smcap">Epicurus</span>
(341-270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) in his Gardens. Epicurus combined the ethical
principle of the Cyrenaics, that pleasure is the end of life, with
the atomistic philosophy of Democritus; he had no respect
for the study of dialectic, but placed the criterion of truth in
the observations of the senses, leaving little room for the participation
of mind or will. Thus in every part of philosophy
his teaching was opposed to that of Zeno, and the two
schools during their whole existence were in the sharpest
conflict. We may nevertheless notice some points of contact
between them. Both founded, or conceived that they founded
their ethical doctrine upon physical proofs; that is, both maintained
that the end of life which they put forward was that
prescribed by natural law. As a consequence, they agreed in
removing the barrier which Socrates had set up against the
pursuit of natural science. Both again were positive teachers,
or (in the language of the ancients) propounders of dogmas;
and here they came into conflict with the Academic school,
which maintained, and was soon about to emphasize, the critical
spirit of Socrates and Plato. For in the last years of Zeno’s life
his old fellow-pupil Arcesilaus became head of the Academic
school (270 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and at once directed his teaching against Zeno’s
theory of knowledge<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. Following the practice of Socrates and
of Plato’s dialogues, he argued against every point of view
presented, and concluded that certain truth could not be known
by man<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. He pressed Zeno closely as to his definition of
‘comprehension,’ and induced him to add a clause which, in the
opinion of his opponent, shewed the worthlessness of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
doctrine<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. Thus was raised the question of the κριτήριον or test
of truth, which for at least a century to come sharply divided the
schools<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno at Athens.</div>

<p id="section85"><b>85.</b> The conflict between these three schools, which from
this time on greatly surpassed all others in importance,
did not embitter the political life of Athens.
The citizens watched with amusement the competition of the
schools for numbers and influence, and drew their profit from
the crowds of foreigners who were drawn to Athens by its
growing fame as a centre of adult education. To the heads of
the schools they were ready to pay every mark of respect. With
Zeno they deposited the keys of their gates, and they awarded
him during his lifetime a gold crown and a bronze statue. His
fame spread abroad, and those of his fellow-citizens of Citium
who were then resident at Sidon claimed a share in it. In his
old age the high-minded Antigonus Gonatas (who occupied the
throne of Macedonia with varying fortune from 278 to 239 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)
looked to him for advice and help. But no offers of public
employment could draw Zeno himself from his simple life and
the young companions who surrounded him: like Socrates, he
thought that he could best serve the State by sending out others
to take part in its duties<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. He died in the year 264 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, having
been engaged in teaching for more than 30 years from the time
when he ‘discovered the truth<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Honours paid to him.</div>

<p id="section86"><b>86.</b> The vote which the Athenians passed in honour of Zeno,
shortly before his death, deserves record by its contrast
with that by which their predecessors had
condemned Socrates. It ran somewhat as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Whereas Zeno the son of Mnaseas from Citium has spent many years
in this city in the pursuit of philosophy; and has been throughout a good
man in all respects; and has encouraged the young men who resorted to
him in virtue and temperance, and has sped them on the right path; and
has made his own life an example to all men, for it has been consistent with
the teaching he has set forth;</p>

<p>Now it seems good to the people of Athens to commend Zeno the son of
Mnaseas from Citium, and to crown him with a golden crown (in accordance
with the law) for his virtue and temperance, and to build him a tomb on the
Ceramicus at the public expense. And the people shall elect five Athenian
citizens to provide for the making of the crown and the building of the tomb.
And the town clerk shall engrave this vote on two pillars, and shall set up
one in the Academy, and one in the Lyceum. And the treasurer shall make
due allotment of the expense, that all men may see that the people of Athens
honours good men both in their life time and after their death<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>We have no reason to doubt the sincerity of this tribute.
It is true that all the charges brought against Socrates hold even
more forcibly as against Zeno. But the spirit of political and
religious independence was now dead, and the advantage of the
philosophical schools to the fame and business interests of the
city had become clearer; so that nothing prevented any longer
the open recognition of Zeno’s virtues and eminence. Who will
may also read in the decree a belated mark of respect to the
memory of Socrates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno’s breadth of view.</div>

<p id="section87"><b>87.</b> In this sketch of the life of Zeno no attempt has been
made to give a complete view of his philosophy;
but a few landmarks have been indicated, by which
it may be possible to distinguish which parts of it were his own,
which were taken over from others, and how all were gradually
combined in one whole. Zeno had not the kind of originality
which begins by assuming a general principle, and then explains
all things human and divine by deductions from it. Instead of
this he gathered together (as Aristotle had done before, but with
a very different bias) what seemed most sound and illuminating
in the teaching of all the schools which surrounded him. He
did this in a positive spirit, feeling assured that truth exists and
is discernible, and must be consistent in all its parts. We seem
unable to say that in his writings he attained to this consistency,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
but at least he worked steadily towards it. The effort for consistency
led him in the direction of monistic principle, though
his points of departure both in physics and in ethics are dualistic.
But the teaching of Zeno does not lend itself to that kind of
study which assigns all new facts to compartments of thought
ready labelled in advance, nor can it be summarized by any of
the technical terms which are in use in modern philosophical
thought. Enough has perhaps been said to shew that, great as
was the debt of Zeno to his predecessors, he was no mere imitator
or plagiarist; the history of the following centuries will shew
that he had in some sense touched the pulses of human life more
truly than any of his contemporaries.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PREACHING OF STOICISM.</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The companions of Zeno.</div>

<p id="section88"><b>88.</b> During the later years of his life Zeno gathered round
him a number of men of practical and speculative
capacity, not unworthy of comparison with the
companions of Socrates. His death dissolved the
immediate tie between them. Some took an active part in the
work of government; others followed their teacher’s example,
and became the founders of independent schools of thought; a
few devoted themselves to strengthening and extending Zeno’s
system; and many were doubtless engaged in useful employment
of which no record has reached us. Zeno’s work had not
yet been exposed to the test of time, and another century was
to pass before it could be seen that the Stoic school was to be of
permanent importance. Towards the schools of the Cynics, the
Megarians, and the Academics, from which its principles were
so largely derived, the attitude of the hearers of Zeno was that
of a friendly interchange of opinions, in which sharp controversy
stopped short of enmity; the followers of Aristotle (the Peripatetics)
continued to be but slightly distinguished from the
Academics. But all these schools appear to have united in
opposition to the Cyrenaics and Epicureans; the champions of
virtue could hold no communings with the advocates of pleasure.
Individual teachers who practically reverted to Cynic or Academic
teaching still called themselves Stoics: but the only one of Zeno’s
hearers who adopted Cyrenaic views was contemptuously branded
as ‘the deserter<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Persaeus.</div>

<p id="section89"><b>89.</b> The most intimate companion<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of Zeno was <span class="smcap">Persaeus</span>
of Citium (circ. 300-243 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). He was the fellow-townsman
of Zeno, and, as good authorities assert,
at first his personal servant (οἰκέτης)<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and afterwards his fellow-lodger.
On the recommendation of Zeno he took service, together
with Aratus the poet, with Antigonus Gonatas, king of Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
Here he was often twitted as to the Stoic paradoxes.
King Antigonus sent him messengers announcing the loss of his
wife, child, and property, and found that he was not entirely
indifferent to external circumstances<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. He adapted himself
easily to court life, and is said to have written a treatise on the
theory of the banquet, in which he did not rise above the moral
standard of his neighbours<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Nor did he disdain to hoax Aristo
of Chius, who held strongly to the paradox that ‘the wise man
never opines’; he first sent him money by one of two twins, and
then sent another to demand it back<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. Another Socratic paradox,
that ‘the wise man is sure to be a good general,’ he
endeavoured to maintain by his personal example<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Antigonus
placed him in command of the acropolis at Corinth, which was
nevertheless taken by Aratus of Sicyon in 243 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> According
to one account, Persaeus was wounded in the attack, and afterwards
put to death by the conqueror<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; others relate that he
escaped to Cenchreae<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. As a philosopher he is of little importance;
but Cicero mentions that he not only maintained that
amongst the gods were men raised to the sky for their services
to mankind (which was an accepted Stoic doctrine), but also
that objects useful to man had been deified<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aratus.</div>

<p id="section90"><b>90.</b> Two other companions of Zeno also took service under
Antigonus, apparently at the same time. Of these
<span class="smcap">Philonides</span> of Thebes<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is otherwise unknown to
us. The other was <span class="smcap">Aratus</span> of Soli in Cilicia, author of the well-known
poem <i>The Phaenomena</i>, an astronomical treatise afterwards
translated into Latin by Cicero, and largely used by Virgil in his
<i>Georgics</i>. The poems of Aratus had a wide influence, and were
probably the source from which so many Stoic conceptions
reached Virgil. The most interesting part for us is the Introduction,
in which he interprets Zeus in Stoic fashion as the deity
who dwells in sea and land, in markets and streets: whose family
is mankind; and whose providence has set the stars in the heaven
to regulate the seasons of the year and to be a guide to the
farmer and the sailor<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. The spirit of this poem is closely akin
to that of the hymn of Cleanthes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sphaerus.</div>

<p id="section91"><b>91.</b> Still another hearer of Zeno took a prominent part
in political life. <span class="smcap">Sphaerus</span> from the Bosphorus
(circ. 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) was attracted to Cleomenes III,
king of Sparta, who under his influence reintroduced the laws
of Lycurgus in his city, and particularly those which referred
to the education of the youth and the taking of meals in common<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.
With these he combined the plan of a monarchy after the Stoic
model, in which the sovereign was to side with the poor against
the rich<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. But in 221 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Cleomenes suffered a crushing defeat,
and was compelled to take refuge with Ptolemy III (Euergetes),
king of Egypt. Sphaerus found his way to the same court.
The death of Ptolemy III left Cleomenes in the position of a
disregarded suppliant<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; but Sphaerus appears to have found a
congenial home in Alexandria, now the centre of Hellenistic
learning, and doubtless introduced the Stoic philosophy in the
circle that gathered round the Museum<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. He gained a special
reputation by the excellence of his definitions<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. From an anecdote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
related of him we must infer that whilst adhering to Zeno’s
doctrine that the wise man will not opine, he accepted reasonable
assurance (τὸ εὔλογον) as a sufficient guide in daily life<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. He
appears to have laid special stress upon the unity of virtue, maintaining
that the separate virtues are but appearances of virtue
or knowledge in different spheres of action<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Herillus.</div>

<p id="section92"><b>92.</b> <span class="smcap">Herillus</span> of Carthage (circ. 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) is frequently
referred to by Cicero as teaching doctrines hardly
distinguishable from those of the Academy, in that
he made knowledge the highest good<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, and taught that separate
from it, yet with claims of their own, there existed inferior ends
of action (ὑποτελίδες)<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. It does not, however, appear clearly
that he differed much from Zeno. Sphaerus, as we have seen,
had defined the virtues as being ‘knowledge displayed in
different spheres of action,’ and the aim of Herillus, ‘to live
according to the standard of life accompanied by knowledge<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>,’
points in the direction of practical rather than of speculative
wisdom. His ‘subordinate aims’ appear also to correspond
with Zeno’s ‘things of high degree’ (προηγμένα), and are
defined as being the first states to which an animal is attracted
upon birth, as food, life, strength (πρῶτα κατὰ φύσιν)<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; they
serve only for ‘ends’ (τέλη) for men who have not yet attained
to wisdom<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. This doctrine corresponds closely to the Stoic
doctrine as developed somewhat later<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Aristo.</div>

<p id="section93"><b>93.</b> <span class="smcap">Aristo</span> of Chios (circ. 250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) departed more decidedly
from Zeno’s teaching, falling back generally on
Cynic views. He was no favourite of Zeno, who
called him a chatterbox<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>: and in later life he was accused of
becoming a flatterer of Persaeus when the latter was in power<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>,
and of luxury in his personal habits<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. But his success as a
teacher was great, and he formed a body of followers who called
themselves Aristonians.</p>

<p>He appears to have supported Zeno vigorously as to the
doctrine of ‘comprehension’; and if on this subject he was
worsted for the moment by Persaeus<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, he retaliated on some
Academic by asking: ‘do you see who is sitting next you?’
The Academic replied ‘I do not.’ ‘Are you blind, then,’ said
Aristo; ‘where are your eyes<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>?’ Still he considered any
systematic study of dialectics to be a mere waste of time; like
spiders’ webs, which seem to display much skill, but are of no
use<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. With regard to physics he was openly agnostic<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; of the
nature of the gods he thought we could know nothing, not even
whether the deity were animate or no<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. Ethics alone remained;
but this part of philosophy he reduced by omitting all practical
precepts, as introducing the element of uncertainty<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. In ethics
proper he rejects the theory of ‘things of high degree’
(προηγμένα), observing that this term does not harmonize with
the treatment of advantages as ‘indifferent,’ but comes dangerously
near to calling them ‘good<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.’ Virtue, or rather knowledge,
is, as he maintains, the only good; and all that lies
between good and evil is alike indifferent<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. The highest good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
may therefore be defined as a state of indifference (ἀδιαφορία)
towards all such things<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>Aristo was however once more in agreement with Stoic
doctrine when he maintained the unity of virtue. ‘The soul,’
he said, ‘has one power only, that of reasoning; one virtue only,
the knowledge of good and evil. When we need to choose the
good and avoid the evil, we call this knowledge Soberness;
when we need to do good and not evil, we call it Wisdom;
Courage, when it is bold and cautious at the right moments;
and when it gives every man his due, Justice<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.’ But in deciding
his action the wise man will be bound by no theories: he can do
whatever comes into his head, provided only he keep himself
free from distress, fear and greed<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>The popularity of these views was repressed by the activity
of Chrysippus; in Cicero’s time they were, in cultivated society,
extinct<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. But from the numerous references to Aristo in literature
it is clear that his teaching was by no means forgotten; and
when there took place the revival of the Cynic tone which we
see illustrated in the writings of Epictetus and M. Aurelius,
Aristo is again treated with high respect<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eratosthenes.</div>

<p id="section94"><b>94.</b> An eminent pupil of Aristo was <span class="smcap">Eratosthenes</span> of
Cyrene, the grammarian, whom he won over from
the Cyrenaic school. Eratosthenes undoubtedly
represented the spirit of his teacher and of the Cynic school
towards which he inclined, when he vehemently repudiated the
prejudice which then divided mankind into Hellenes and barbarians<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.
He was invited by Ptolemy III (Euergetes) to be
chief librarian of the Museum at Alexandria, and tutor to the
crown-prince, and has left us an epigram in honour of this great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
patron of learning and philosophy<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. Amongst other followers of
Aristo we hear specially of <span class="smcap">Apollophanes</span> of Antiochia<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dionysius.</div>

<p id="section95"><b>95.</b> Alone amongst the hearers of Zeno <span class="smcap">Dionysius</span> of
Heraclea abandoned his principles, and went over
from the camp of virtue to that of pleasure. A
painful disease of the eyes had made him abandon the doctrine
that ‘pain is no evil<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.’ His secession was used by Antiochus as
an argument against the doctrine of comprehension or certain
knowledge<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. That his life after he became a Cyrenaic was
openly scandalous<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> we need not too readily believe: such
accusations may easily be mere deductions from his supposed
philosophic principles. Dionysius appears to have been a
particular friend and admirer of the poet Aratus<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the less important hearers of Zeno we have the names
of, amongst others, <span class="smcap">Athenodorus</span> of Soli<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, <span class="smcap">Callippus</span> of
Corinth<a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, <span class="smcap">Posidonius</span> of Alexandria<a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, and <span class="smcap">Zeno</span> of Sidon<a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.
The last, if he existed, must be kept distinct from other Zenos,
such as Zeno of Tarsus the pupil of Chrysippus, and Zeno of
Sidon the Epicurean philosopher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cleanthes.</div>

<p id="section96"><b>96.</b> We come last amongst Zeno’s hearers to <span class="smcap">Cleanthes</span> of
Assos in Asia Minor (331-232 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), who succeeded
Zeno as head of the school when already advanced
in years, and presided over it for a whole generation. In personal
character he was a worthy successor of Socrates, Diogenes, and
Zeno. He was trained in hardship and willing endurance<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>;
and if he did not quickly understand, yet all he learnt was
deeply impressed upon him<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. He studied Zeno’s life even more
attentively than his doctrines; lived with him, watched his hours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
of retirement, inquired whether his actions corresponded to his
teaching<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. Himself a man of the people, he ardently desired to
spread his convictions amongst the many, and chose verse as the
best means to express clearly his meaning and win access to
men’s ears<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. He remained constant to Zeno’s teaching<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, but
he inspired it with a fresh enthusiasm and developed it in more
consistent detail. He is before all things the theologian of
Stoicism. The belief in the deity, which in the fragments of
Zeno’s teaching appears merely formal and argumentative, becomes
in the verse of Cleanthes ardent and dominating. God
is the creator and the director of the world; his Logos gives
it order and harmony. In God’s designs it is the privilege and
duty of man to cooperate; but since he is possessed of free
will, it is also within his power to make a futile opposition. In
this way the good and the bad stand in definite contrast.
Finally, right knowledge and right action are only possible by
association with the deity through praise and prayer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Originality of Cleanthes.</div>

<p id="section99"><b>99.</b> To the ancients Cleanthes was the faithful disciple of
Zeno. Persaeus, Aratus, and others had turned aside
from the direct pursuit of philosophy, and their
contact with science and politics might easily sully the purity
of their philosophic creed. Herillus had adopted Academic
doctrine, Aristo had fallen back into Cynism, Dionysius had
actually seceded to the party of pleasure. It might seem that the
far-reaching sweep of Zeno’s intellect had no real hold on his
companions. But Cleanthes at least stood firm by the old landmarks.
We must not suppose from this that he was a man of
no originality<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; his language and his style at least are his own.
Nor on the other hand can we go all the way with some recent
writers, who attribute to him exclusively large parts of the Stoic
system<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Our authorities commonly refer either to Zeno alone,
or to Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus jointly, as vouching for
accepted Stoic doctrine; and we are hardly entitled to lay great
stress on the comparatively few fragments of which the authorship
is assigned exclusively to Cleanthes, as evidence for the
independence of his teaching; especially as we can in many
instances see that our authorities delight in attributing a difference
of meaning to the Stoic masters, when in reality there is
nothing more to be found than a difference of phrasing<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. It is
however clear that Stoicism did not assume its complete form in
the hands of its first propagator; and to a limited extent we can
see the directions in which his teaching was amplified by his
successors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physics of Cleanthes.</div>

<p id="section100"><b>100.</b> Cleanthes took a special interest in the physical speculations
of Heraclitus, on whose writings he composed
four books<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, and in particular in the bearing
of his speculations upon the nature of the deity. The belief in
the dualism of God and matter, of the Word and the world, is
attributed to Cleanthes as distinctly as to Zeno<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; but on the
other hand the conception of an overruling unity is much more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
pronounced in the later writer<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Hence from the first Cleanthes
endeavours to give a wider meaning to the primary fire of
Heraclitus, the creative fire of Zeno. For this fire he proposed
the new term ‘flame’ (φλόξ)<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; at other times he identified it
with the sky<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>, with the sun<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, and with the principle of heat<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>;
and finally adopted the term ‘spirit’ (πνεῦμα, <i>spiritus</i>), which has
ever since held its place in the discussion of natural theology.
This term appears to have been at first intended to combine the
conceptions of the creative fire and of the Logos<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, but it gradually
came to have distinctive associations of its own. Like fire,
‘spirit’ is to the Stoics a substance, stuff, or body akin to the
element of air, but associated with warmth and elasticity; it is
conceived as immanent in the universe and penetrating it as the
deity; immanent in the human body and penetrating it as the
soul<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. The elasticity of spirit is measured by its ‘tension’
(τόνος, <i>intentio</i>), by means of which its creative power pushes
forward from the centre to the circumference: as for instance in
the human body walking is effected by ‘spirit exercising tension
towards the feet<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.’ The theory of ‘tension’ has an immediate
application to ethics. When the soul has sufficient tension to
perform its proper work, it operates according to the virtues of
Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Soberness; but when the tension
is relaxed, the soul becomes disordered and is seized upon by
the emotions<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theology of Cleanthes.</div>

<p id="section101"><b>101.</b> To Cleanthes also it fell to explain more fully the
government both of the universe and of the individual.
Zeno indeed is said to have used the term
ἡγεμονικόν (<i>principale</i>, <i>principatus</i>)<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, which we may translate by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
‘ruling power,’ or shortly (following the Latin) by ‘principate<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>,’
for the highest power of the human soul; Cleanthes sought a
similar principle in the universe also, and is said to have found
it in the sun<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. By thus using the term in a double sense he
implies the analogy which is expressed by the correlative terms
‘macrocosm’ and ‘microcosm,’ and which leads up to the definition
of God as the ‘soul of the universe<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.’ Cleanthes further
speaks of the universe itself as god<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>; but before describing him
as a pantheist it is well to consider that this is only one form out
of many in which he expresses his creed. He was also the first
to give the four proofs of the existence of the deity upon which
all discussions of the ‘evidences of Natural Religion’ have been
based down to the present day, and which we shall further
discuss in a later chapter<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>The pious zeal of Cleanthes was not without a touch of
bigotry, destined to have serious consequences in the final
developments of Stoicism, and to reappear in the history of
the middle ages with distressing intensity; he was bitterly opposed
to the novel heliocentric theory of the universe as an
impiety<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakness of Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section102"><b>102.</b> Thus even though we can no longer discriminate
sharply between the teaching of Zeno and that of
Cleanthes, we have every reason to suppose that
the latter was possessed of originality of thought and vigour
and copiousness of expression. We cannot easily believe that
a man of such powers failed to attract hearers or to retain a
hold upon them. But in his extreme old age it seems that the
majority were drawn aside either to the ingenious arguments of
Arcesilaus the Academic, or to the more independent teaching
of Aristo of Chios. The continued existence of Stoicism seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
threatened; its critics were not to be contented with rhetoric or
poetry, but insistently demanded proofs. In this crisis it was
saved and established by a younger man, <span class="smcap">Chrysippus</span> of Soli
(280-206 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), who was far inferior in original power, but equally
zealous and more in harmony with the tastes and demands of
the younger generation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chrysippus.</div>

<p id="section103"><b>103.</b> Chrysippus was a fellow-townsman of Aratus of Soli,
and his appearance is doubtless a sign of the active
interest in philosophy which for some centuries
marks the neighbourhood of the important town of Tarsus.
Born in 280 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he found in his early manhood three prominent
teachers at Athens, Arcesilaus, Aristo, and Cleanthes. Of these
Aristo seems to have been the most popular, and surprise was
expressed that Chrysippus did not join his school. ‘Had I
followed the many,’ he replied, ‘I should not have become a
philosopher<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.’ His convictions drew him to Cleanthes, but he
felt much impatience with his methods. This state of mind he
must have expressed freely, for in after life he reproached himself
that he had not behaved more kindly towards his teacher in his
old age<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. Confident in his own powers, he desired to relieve
Cleanthes of the burden of replying to the many attacks made
upon his doctrines, especially as to dialectics<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. It is well known
that he asked his master to supply him with his dogmas only,
saying that he himself would find the proofs<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Chrysippus
probably outlived his opponents, and during the time when he
was head of the school (232-206 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) only found himself opposed
by men of mediocre talents. He devoted his whole energies to
strengthening and systematizing Stoic doctrine. He not only
gave its proofs, but used every art of the dialectician to recommend
it to his hearers<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. From his facile pen there poured an
endless stream of writings, not remarkable either for originality
or for style, but of the highest importance as fixing definitely the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
standard of Stoic orthodoxy. He gathered numerous hearers
round him, and before his death it could truly be said that he
had saved the Stoa<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dialectic of Chrysippus.</div>

<p id="section104"><b>104.</b> In his method of exposition Chrysippus made great
use of the syllogism, thus reverting to the practice
of Zeno as opposed to the more poetical style of
Cleanthes. As to the value of this syllogistic reasoning very
contrary opinions were expressed in antiquity. By his contemporaries
he was greatly admired, so that it was said that ‘if the
gods had needed a dialectic, they would have taken that of
Chrysippus<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.’ On the other hand members of his own school
complained that he often stated his opponents’ case more forcibly
than his own<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. The Romans mix their praise with censure, and
find that he sometimes entangles himself in the threads of his own
argument<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>; and we ourselves cannot fail to notice that when his
major and minor premisses are compared, the meaning of the
common term has usually shifted<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. But if Chrysippus did not
provide a final solution to great problems, he at least adapted
the Stoic system to the taste of his age, alike by his use of
syllogisms and by the attention he paid to the solution of
fallacies<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opposition of the Academy.</div>

<p id="section105"><b>105.</b> Whilst the works of Chrysippus cover the whole range
of the Stoic philosophy, their special colour is
largely due to the interests of his own time. The
stress laid by Zeno on the certainty of knowledge had produced a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
reaction in the Academic school. Arcesilaus, who had succeeded
Polemo as its leader, leaving on one side the positive teaching of
Plato’s later years, reverted to the sceptical attitude which had
been one characteristic of Socrates, and which is so prominent in
most of the Platonic dialogues<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. He attacked with the utmost
vigour Zeno’s doctrine of ‘comprehension’; and further argued
that certain knowledge is unnecessary for practical life, of which
probability, that is, such action as can find reasonable justification,
is the sufficient guide<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. Chrysippus defended with the
utmost energy the dogma of the certainty of knowledge, based
upon the perspicuity of true mind pictures<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>; but the teaching of
Arcesilaus obtained a hold upon him, and (as we shall see) was
ultimately allowed by him a place within the Stoic system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of Epicureanism.</div>

<p id="section106"><b>106.</b> Chrysippus meanwhile had a more dangerous enemy
to meet than the Academy. During the weakness
which befel the Stoic school in the middle of the
third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the rival school of Epicurus had won an
enormous popularity. Yet its ethical standard, which it had
inherited from the Cyrenaics, offended not only the followers of
Zeno but all sober-minded philosophers. For Epicurus had set
up Pleasure as the queen of life, and had converted the virtues
into her handmaidens<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>; and so far was he from taking interest
in model states, that he advised his hearers to hold aloof altogether
from public life. Worst of all, his followers only smiled
at the reproofs that were showered upon them. They formed
among themselves a cheerful, affectionate, and united society;
their simple pleasures created no public scandal, though their
entertainments were often enlivened by tales of the moral lapses
of their self-righteous rivals. The bracing morality of Cynism
seemed to be quite gone out of fashion, and even the Aristonians
had ceased to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alliance of the three schools.</div>

<p id="section107"><b>107.</b> Under these circumstances the remaining schools began
to look one to another for support, and were even
brought into a kind of alliance. The adherents of
the Academy and the Porch, in particular, began to meet in
friendly discussion, and sometimes defined anew their doctrines
so as to minimize points of difference, sometimes directly modified
them by way of concession to opposed arguments. This
process resulted in a toning down of Stoicism in every part of its
system. The Stoic teachers began to disregard or push into the
background those characteristic doctrines which had been embodied
in the Socratic paradoxes and enforced by the Cynic
propaganda. Thus their teaching gave less offence to the lax
crowd, and at the same time (it must be admitted) less support
to the striving few; but its tone was now so modest that men of
gentle and judicious temperament were attracted to Stoicism for
the first time. Stoicism began now to shew itself receptive of
literary influences, especially as regards the works of Plato and
Aristotle, and even appreciative of artistic ideals. Such was
the tendency of the system during both the second and the first
centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; but it is more difficult to estimate the extent of the
deviation. Terms like εὐκρασία ‘well proportioned mixture<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>,’
εὔροια ‘even flow<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>,’ εὐτονία ‘due tone<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>,’ συμφωνία ‘harmony<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>,’
are attributed even to the earliest masters: whilst it is abundantly
clear that the Socratic and Cynic paradoxes formed at
all times part of the generally accepted view of Stoic doctrine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chrysippus inclines to the Academy.</div>

<p id="section108"><b>108.</b> It is an interesting question, which perhaps needs
further investigation, to what extent this approximation
between the doctrines of the Academy and
the Porch can be traced in the writings of Chrysippus.
On the one hand we must remember that Chrysippus was a
man of distinctly orthodox temperament; he firmly opposed the
Cynizing heresies of Aristo, and strongly defended the Stoic
theory of knowledge against the Academy. But our knowledge
of the teaching of Chrysippus, abundant in volume, is lacking in
precision. Our authorities, as we have seen, very imperfectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
distinguish, and very inadequately record, the teaching of the
two earlier masters; and the doctrines which are regarded as
common to all Stoics must be assumed to be generally stated in
the language of Chrysippus, whose works remained for centuries
the recognised standard of orthodoxy. Even so there are few
distinctive doctrines of Chrysippus which do not seem to be
foreshadowed in expressions attributed to some earlier teacher.
Yet we may fairly assume that in his ethical teaching there was
a substantial sacrifice of the forcefulness of the Socratic character,
and a corresponding approach to Academic views. This appears
when he defines the supreme good as ‘a life according to nature,
that is, both general nature and our individual human nature<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>,’
and adds, ‘for our individual natures are parts of the nature of
the all<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.’ This approaches the doctrine of ‘virtue appropriate
to the individual’ (οἰκεία ἀρετή), as taught by the Academics<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.
A still more striking concession is his permission to men engaged
in practical life to describe advantages as ‘good things,’ provided
they are carefully distinguished from the supreme good<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Successors of Chrysippus.</div>

<p id="section109"><b>109.</b> The weakening hold of the Stoics upon the principles
of their founder first becomes evident in the department
of physics. Thus it is an essential part of the
theory which the Stoics borrowed from Heraclitus, that as the
whole universe has proceeded from the all-creative fire, so it
must in due course be re-absorbed in it, this periodical re-absorption
being technically known as the ‘conflagration’
(ἐκπύρωσις). On the other hand the followers of Aristotle,
following dualistic principles, placed God and the universe in
eternal contrast, and held both to be immortal. Ingenious controversialists
now pressed the Stoics to explain how their deity
exercised his providence during the periodic intervals in which
the universe had no separate existence. This and like arguments
had an immediate effect. <span class="smcap">Boëthus</span> of Sidon, a contemporary
of Chrysippus, abandoned altogether the Stoic theory on this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
subject<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>; <span class="smcap">Zeno</span> of Tarsus, who had been with his father
<span class="smcap">Dioscorides</span> a pupil of Chrysippus, and who succeeded him
as head of the school, discreetly ‘suspended his judgment’ upon
the point<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. But whatever its theoretical embarrassments, the
Stoic school continued to prosper. Zeno of Tarsus wrote but
few books, but had more disciples than any other<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>; he was
succeeded by <span class="smcap">Seleucus</span> of the Tigris<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>, and he in turn by
Diogenes<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, Antipater, and Panaetius. The last of these maintained
Zeno’s ‘suspense of judgment<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>’ on the question of the
conflagration; but after his death the Stoics quietly returned to
the older opinion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diogenes and Antipater.</div>

<p id="section110"><b>110.</b> <span class="smcap">Diogenes</span> of Seleucia (circ. 238-150 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; often called
‘of Babylon,’ or simply <i>Diogenes Stoicus</i>), and
<span class="smcap">Antipater</span> of Tarsus (circ. 200-129 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), were
both men of eminence in the history of Stoicism<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, but they
were unequally matched against Carneades (218-128 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), who
was head of the Academic school about the same time, and who
proclaimed the doctrine of a universal suspension of judgment.
The many volumes of Chrysippus gave Carneades ample opportunities
for the exercise of his critical powers; and Antipater,
unable or unwilling to meet him in open argument, fell himself
into the evil habit of book-writing<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. Both these teachers
specially interested themselves in questions of casuistry.
Diogenes, who defined the good as ‘reasonableness in the
choice of natural ends<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>,’ adopted practically that interpretation
of ‘reasonableness’ in which divine reason has the least part,
and human plausibility the freest play<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. Thus he discusses
the problems whether the seller of a house ought to inform the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
purchaser of its defects, and whether a man upon whom false
coins have been passed may transfer them to his neighbour<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.
Exactly as Carneades<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, he finds ‘reasonable excuse’ for the less
scrupulous course. Antipater on the other hand holds that a
man’s duty to his neighbour requires perfect frankness<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>; yet he
is said to have abandoned the Socratic doctrine of the self-sufficiency
of virtue, and to have held that external goods are a
part (though only a small part) of the supreme good<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lesser Stoics.</div>

<p id="section111"><b>111.</b> We may now shortly mention some less important
Stoic teachers, chiefly of the early part of the
second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, since their number alone is
an indication of the wide influence of the sect. <span class="smcap">Aristocreon</span>,
said to have been the nephew of Chrysippus, set up a statue in
his honour, as the man who could cut his way through the knots
tied by the Academics<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. <span class="smcap">Zenodotus</span> was a pupil of Diogenes,
and wrote an epigram on Zeno: he at least defended the ‘manly
doctrine’ of the founder, and recalled the principle of the
sufficiency of virtue<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. <span class="smcap">Apollodorus</span> of Seleucia on the
Tigris<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> (sometimes called Ephillus<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>), another pupil of Diogenes,
leant towards Cynic views; for he declared that ‘the wise man
will be a Cynic, for this is a short cut to virtue<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>’; an opinion
afterwards adopted by the Stoics generally<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. He also wrote on
physics. A third pupil of Diogenes was <span class="smcap">Apollodorus</span> of
Athens<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. Closely associated with Antipater is <span class="smcap">Archedemus</span>
of Tarsus; like his fellow-townsman, he was greatly devoted to
dialectics<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>; in ethics he appears to have inclined strongly to
Academic views, holding that the end of life was the regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
performance of daily duties<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. Just about the time we have
now reached (the middle of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) Eumenes II
founded the great library at Pergamus, intended to rival that of
Alexandria. As librarian he installed a Stoic philosopher,
<span class="smcap">Crates</span> of Mallos, who devoted much of his time to grammatical
inquiries, and endeavoured to bring Homer into accord
with the Stoic views on geography<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>; he is the first Stoic of
whom we hear at Rome, which he visited about 159 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Being
detained there by an accident, he employed his time in giving
lectures on literature<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>; and his pupil Panaetius was destined
to introduce Stoicism to Roman society. Lastly we may mention
<span class="smcap">Heraclides</span> of Tarsus, a pupil of Antipater, said to have
broken away from the teaching of the school by denying that
all sins are equal<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. Athenodorus of Tarsus, who held the
same view, belongs to a later generation<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. Of uncertain date
are <span class="smcap">Basilides</span>, who pushed his monism so far as to declare that
all things, even statements, are bodies<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>; <span class="smcap">Eudromus</span>, who wrote
on the elements of ethics<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; and <span class="smcap">Crinis</span>, who interested himself
in logic<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STOIC SECT IN ROME.</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Growth of the Stoic ‘sect.’</div>

<p id="section112"><b>112.</b> In the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Stoicism won adherents slowly
and one by one, as individuals were convinced by
reasoning and example. In the second century its
progress became more rapid, for it was reinforced by inheritance
and social influence. Fathers handed down its doctrine to their
sons, and teachers to their pupils. Groups of men united by a
common respect for the school and its founders began to associate
together, not only at Athens, but also (as we may well infer
from the list of names given at the end of the last chapter) at such
centres as Pergamus, Babylon, Seleucia, Tarsus, Sidon, and even
Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Thus out of the school there grew up the ‘sect’
(<i>secta</i>); that is, a society of men drawn from different nations and
ranks, but sharing the same convictions, united by a bond of
brotherhood, and feeling their way towards mutual consolation
and support; a company going through life on the same path,
and prepared to submit to a common authority<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. The spread of
the sect was rapid though quiet; and as we cannot expect to
trace its history from place to place, we are unable to say when
first it found adherents at Rome. But early in the second
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Rome entered into close political relations with two
of the most highly civilized states of Asia Minor, Pergamus and
Rhodes; and through the men of learning and taste who were
associated with these communities Stoicism was introduced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the ruling class at the centre of the new empire, to win there an
easy conquest which proved no slight compensation for the
political subordination of the states from which its emissaries
had sprung.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Panaetius.</div>

<p id="section113"><b>113.</b> We have already noticed<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that the Stoic Crates, the
head of the library established at Pergamus, visited
Rome in 159 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and there gave lectures on literature,
in which he may perhaps have taken occasion to expound
at least the chief doctrines of the Stoic school. Only a few years
later, in 155 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the celebrated embassy from Athens, which
included the heads of three of the chief philosophical schools
at that time, arrived in Rome. Diogenes of Seleucia represented
the Stoics, Critolaus the Peripatetics, and Carneades the Academic
school; and all three expounded their respective theories
before enormous audiences. We are told that Diogenes made
a good impression by his sober and temperate style<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Thus
the way was prepared for the more permanent influence of
<span class="smcap">Panaetius</span> of Rhodes (circ. 189-109 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. He was a gentleman
of position in the wealthy and well-governed island state, and in
early youth pursued his studies at Pergamus, so that he was
probably attracted to the school by Crates<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. From Pergamus he
passed to Athens, where he found established the three teachers
already named, and attached himself to Diogenes<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, and after his
death to his successor Antipater<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. His writings shew that he was
also much influenced by the teaching of Carneades. But more
than any of his predecessors he appreciated philosophy in its
literary form. Plato, the ‘Homer of philosophers,’ he held in
veneration<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; from Aristotle, Xenocrates, Theophrastus and
Dicaearchus he constantly quoted<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. His admiration for these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
philosophers greatly influenced his style, and caused him to
reject the stiff and paradoxical form used by his predecessors<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>;
it also led to the surrender of some characteristic Stoic doctrines
in favour of the teaching of Plato and Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. His studies
extended to every branch of philosophy, including astronomy<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and politics<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. The latter interest brought him into association
with Polybius the historian, with whom he held frequent discussions
as to the best form of government; the two learned and
experienced Greeks agreed in their admiration for the constitution
of Rome<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. Panaetius visited Rome, and there became the
intimate friend of Scipio Africanus minor: this friendship must
have begun before the year 140 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when Panaetius accompanied
Scipio on a mission to settle the affairs of the East<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; it lasted
till the death of Scipio in 129 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Round Scipio and his Greek
friends Polybius and Panaetius there gathered a society of the
noblest and most intelligent men of Rome; and in this circle
the Latin language as well as Greek philosophy found a new
birth. At the time of Scipio’s death Panaetius became the head
of the Stoic school at Athens, and held this position till his
own death twenty years later<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Amongst his friends and pupils
were men who took a leading part in the government of their
native cities<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His ethical teaching.</div>

<p id="section114"><b>114.</b> Panaetius may well be regarded as the founder of
Roman Stoicism, and is of special interest to us as
the writer of the treatise (περὶ καθήκοντος) which
Cicero has freely translated in his <i>de Officiis</i>. He sets before us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Stoicism as the school which will train the scholar, the gentleman,
and the statesman, whilst he shrinks from those bolder doctrines,
borrowed from the Cynic school, which conflict with that which
is conventional, or, as their opponents say, with that which is
becoming. The central doctrine that virtue is knowledge, and
is the sole and sufficient good, he accepts as the plain teaching
of nature; and with it the paradox that the wise man never
errs<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Yet even these maxims are somewhat toned down as he
expresses them; and external advantages appear to him worthy
of pursuit, not only as giving a meaning to virtue and providing
a field for its exercise, but also for their own sake, so long as
they do not conflict with virtue<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; and he perhaps hesitated to
assert positively that ‘pain is no evil<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.’ In his treatises the
figure of the wise man is withdrawn to the background; he is
practically concerned only with the ‘probationer’ (ὁ προκόπτων),
who is making some advance in the direction of wisdom. This
advance is not made by acts of perfect virtue, but by regular
performance of ‘services’ (καθήκοντα, <i>officia</i>), the simple and
daily duties which come in the way of the good citizen<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.
Further, scientific investigation must not become the main
end of life, as perhaps it seemed to Aristotle; it is permitted
only as a recreation in the well-earned intervals between the
calls of active life<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His views on physics.</div>

<p id="section115"><b>115.</b> It does not appear that Panaetius devoted much attention
to logic<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; on the other hand he was much
occupied with that part of philosophy which deals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
with the history of the universe and its government by divine
providence<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. The Heraclitean theory he appears to have left
altogether on one side; for he rejected the theory of the conflagration<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>,
as Boethus had done before him, accepting the objection
of Carneades that ‘if everything turned into fire, the fire would
go out for lack of fuel<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.’ He therefore joined the Peripatetics in
holding that the universe is immortal<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; but since again Carneades
has shown that ‘no living thing is immortal,’ it follows that the
world is not an animal, nor is the deity its soul<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Upon all
these subjects Panaetius ceased to maintain Stoic doctrines; and,
alone amongst Stoic teachers, he ‘suspended his judgment’ as to
the reality of divination<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concession in ethics.</div>

<p id="section116"><b>116.</b> Similar concessions to his opponents mark his treatment
in detail of ethics. Thus he takes from
Aristotle the view that ‘virtue is a mean between
two vices’; and this doctrine, so alien from true Stoic principle,
forms the basis of the treatment which we find adopted in the
<i>de Officiis</i>. The theory of the four ‘cardinal virtues,’ Wisdom,
Justice, Courage, and Soberness, was probably common property
at this time; but whereas in Cynism Courage and in the earlier
Stoicism Wisdom are the dominant virtues, in the theory of
Panaetius Soberness, identified with decorum, far exceeds the
rest in practical importance. Thus the triumph won by Panaetius
for the name of Stoicism was purchased by the sacrifice not only
of its physics, but very largely of its ethics also; and the success
of the new system might not unfairly be described as a victory
of literature over logic, of reasonableness over reason, and of
compromise over consistency. However this may be, Panaetius
undoubtedly succeeded in presenting Greek philosophy to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Roman friends in a form in which it recommended itself alike
to their reasoning powers and to their moral sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Posidonius.</div>

<p id="section117"><b>117.</b> The virtual, though not the nominal, successor of
Panaetius was <span class="smcap">Posidonius</span> of Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> (circ. 135-51
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>), who after studying under Panaetius at
Athens travelled widely, finally settling at Rhodes, and there
took an active part in political life. Like his master, he was
a devoted student of Plato, and he wrote a commentary on the
<i>Timaeus</i>. In this commentary he developes a new theory of the
universe, which he asserts to be that which Plato had learnt from
the Pythagoreans, and to be at root the same as that taught by
the Stoics. The starting-point is the μονάς or unit; from this
are evolved the numbers and the elements by a principle of flux,
as in the system of Heraclitus<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. The unity and the first of the
numbers, the two, differ as force and matter; so that the dualism
of Aristotle is here definitely subordinated to a supreme monism.
This study of Posidonius is therefore incidentally of high importance
as a side-light on Stoic metaphysics and cosmology.
In addition he wrote on almost all the principal divisions of
philosophy, thus acquiring a brilliant reputation, particularly in
the eyes of the philosophic nobles of Rome. Cicero made his
acquaintance at Rhodes in 78 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and refers to him more often
in his works than to any other of his instructors<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. Pompey, in
the midst of his eastern campaigns, put himself to much trouble
to visit him<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. Amongst his Roman visitors and admirers were
also Velleius, Cotta, and Lucilius<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. A century later, Seneca
looked back to him as one of those who had made the largest
contribution to philosophy<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His teaching.</div>

<p id="section118"><b>118.</b> As compared with the more scientific Panaetius, Posidonius
marks a reaction in favour of the religious
side of Stoicism<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. Thus it comes about that Cicero
bases on his work ‘on gods’ (περὶ θεῶν) his own statement of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Stoic theology in the second book of his <i>de Natura deorum</i><a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
Posidonius restores the theory of Divination, as to which Panaetius
had held the gravest doubts<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. He strongly asserts the
divine origin of the soul, and accepts the Persian view that in
this life it is imprisoned in the body<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. He affirmed the future
conflagration<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, and found this theory not inconsistent with a
belief in the pre-existence and the immortality of the individual
soul.</p>

<p>In physics and logic alike Posidonius upholds the doctrine
of the Logos, and it appears that it passed directly from him to
Philo of Alexandria, and so into Judaeo-Christian speculation.
In ethics he maintained the sufficiency of virtue<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, and re-defined
it in the spirit of Cleanthes rather than of Chrysippus<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. In the
practical application of such doctrines to cases of conscience he
disliked the lax views of Diogenes, and sided rather with
Antipater and Panaetius<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. Finally he held that the ideal
Republic had already been achieved in the golden age, when
the wise had ruled for the protection and happiness of their
subjects<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hecato.</div>

<p id="section119"><b>119.</b> <span class="smcap">Hecato</span> of Rhodes was also a pupil of Panaetius:
he wrote books on ethics and casuistry which were
largely used by Cicero and by Seneca, both of whom
frequently refer to him by name. In laying the foundations of his
ethics he distinguishes between the ‘theoretic virtues,’ such as
Wisdom, Justice, Courage and Soberness, which call for the assent
of the individual, and are possessed only by the wise man, and the
corresponding ‘non-theoretic virtues,’ which are dispositions of
body found also amongst the unwise; as health which corresponds
to temperance, and so forth<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. By this extension of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
conception of virtue the doctrine of its sufficiency is rendered
easy of acceptance<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. In the practical application of his theory
he laid great stress on the doctrine of ‘relations’ (σχέσεις), that
is on duties towards parent, wife, child, slave, country, and so
forth<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. In order to be in a position to perform these duties a
man is entitled to care for his own life and property<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. He need
not be too careful to provide for his slaves if provisions are
dear<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>; nor should he too hastily give up for another his chance
of escape from a shipwreck<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. Hecato therefore seems rather to
side with Diogenes in questions of casuistry, taking a lax view
where Antipater and Panaetius would be inclined to a more
altruistic standpoint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The unsectarian philosopher.</div>

<p id="section120"><b>120.</b> The three teachers of Rhodes appear to us as men of
great learning and of wide interests, and not without
original force; on the other hand we cannot say
that they made any very large contributions towards
the discussion of the great problems of philosophy. Apart
from them we find little trace of creative ability in the school
during the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> There were however numerous
teachers occupied in expounding and defending the doctrines of
the school, and their special interest lay in the controversies
between the Porch and the Academy. From these there resulted
a temporary fusion of the two schools. Their respective
names and dogmas remained unaltered; but attention was no
longer given to the great differences of principle which divided
them. Learning, politics, and social influences alike were at work,
not to solve the great controversies, but to throw a mist over
them. From these circumstances there emerged the type which
we now call the ‘eclectic,’ but which the Romans called simply
the ‘philosopher’; that is, the man who drew practical wisdom
from all sources alike, binding himself to the dogmas of no
school, but winning his way by aptness of discourse and sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
of manner to social importance<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. We have but a limited interest
at the present day in these ephemeral reputations; the type is
still with us, both in the preacher whose sympathies are given
with equal readiness to half-a-dozen warring denominations, and
in the politician who emphasizes his connexion by birth with
three or four nationalities and as many grades of society. Nor
are we called upon to question the usefulness of this blurring of
differences. We must however remark that so far as our immediate
subject is concerned, the fusion was equivalent to a defeat
of Stoicism by the Academy. That nothing can be definitely
proved; that a man may choose his principles at the bidding of
his fancy; that an argument may be sufficiently sound for practical
purposes even when there exists a counter-argument of
almost equal strength; that the problems of dialectics, physics,
and ethics may be discussed separately, instead of being treated
as parts of one whole; all these are the points for which the
Academic contended with as much consistency as his system
allowed, and which every philosopher, whether or not he called
himself a Stoic, conceded when he began to combine the teachings
of diverse systems.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lesser Stoics.</div>

<p id="section121"><b>121.</b> After the death of Panaetius the school at Athens
appears to have been conducted by <span class="smcap">Dardanus</span> and
<span class="smcap">Mnesarchus</span>, both of Athens, jointly<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; later we
find at its head <span class="smcap">Dionysius</span> of Cyrene, who enjoyed a great
reputation as a mathematician, and was a vigorous opponent of
Demetrius the Epicurean<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. About the same time<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> <span class="smcap">Athenodorus</span>
the elder of Tarsus (circ. 130-60 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) became librarian
at Pergamus; he made use of his position to erase from Zeno’s
works those passages (probably from the <i>Republic</i>) which were
repugnant to the Stoic teaching of his own time; he was however
detected and the passages in question were restored<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. It
appears also that he counselled withdrawal from the vexations of
public life, a policy by no means consistent with the teaching of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Zeno, and for which he is rebuked by Seneca<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. From him we
first hear the practical precept which both Seneca and Juvenal
echo, to ask nothing of the gods that you cannot ask openly<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.
In his old age he left Pergamus and came to reside at Rome
with M. Porcius Cato in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 70. Amongst the younger friends
of Cato were <span class="smcap">Antipater</span> of Tyre, who wrote on practical ethics,
and died at Athens about 45 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>; and <span class="smcap">Apollonides</span>, with
whom he conversed on the subject of suicide shortly before his
death<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. From <span class="smcap">Diodotus</span> Cicero received instruction in Stoicism
before 88 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; he conceived a great affection for him, and
invited him to live in his house<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>: he remained there till his
death in 59 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when he left Cicero a considerable property<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.
In his old age he was blind, but he continued his studies, and in
particular that of mathematics, as ardently as ever<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. <span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>
of Tyre wrote a biography of Zeno, from which Diogenes
Laertius often quotes<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. To this period perhaps belongs
<span class="smcap">Hierocles</span>, who was bitterly opposed to Epicurus on account
of his choosing pleasure as the end of life, and still more for
his denial of providence<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cicero.</div>

<p id="section122"><b>122.</b> We have little reason to regret that only fragments at
most remain to us of the works of these philosophers,
since <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> presents to us a comprehensive view
not only of the doctrines they professed, but also of the criticisms
which their opponents passed upon them, and again of the
replies they made to these criticisms. In carrying out this work
for Stoicism and its rival systems Cicero not only created the
philosophic terminology of the future by his translations of
technical terms from Greek into Latin, but also established a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
new style of philosophic discussion. By the friendly tone of his
dialogues, placed in the mouths of men whose common interest
in Greek studies made the divergencies of the schools to which
they belonged a secondary matter; by the amplitude of his style,
which gives itself time and space to approach a difficult conception
from many points of view; and by the simplicity of his
language and illustrations, which assumes that every philosophical
contention can be plainly and forcibly put before the average
man of letters, he has set an example of the art of exposition
which has perhaps not been surpassed since<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. His most
systematic expositions of Stoic doctrine are as follows. In the
<i>Academica</i> a general view of Zeno’s teaching is given by
M. Varro (i 10, 35 to 11, 42), and the Stoic logic, as accepted
by Antiochus<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, is defended by L. Licinius Lucullus (ii 1, 1 to
19, 63). In the <i>de Natura deorum</i> (bk ii) the Stoic physics is
explained by Q. Lucilius Balbus; in the <i>de Finibus</i> (bk iii) the
Stoic ethics by M. Porcius Cato, as the most distinguished Roman
who has adopted them as a standard of life. In the <i>de Officiis</i>
Cicero adopts the form of a letter addressed to his son when
studying at Athens, and avowedly adapts the substance of the
work of Panaetius already mentioned, supplementing it from a
memorandum of the teaching of Posidonius which was specially
prepared for him by <span class="smcap">Athenodorus Calvus</span><a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; this book deals
with ethics mainly in its practical applications. In many of his
other works, such as the <i>de Amicitia</i>, <i>de Senectute</i>, <i>Tusculan
disputations</i>, <i>de Fato</i>, <i>de Divinatione</i>, and <i>Paradoxa</i>, Cicero makes
use of Stoic material without giving professedly an exposition of
the Stoic system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Areius Didymus.</div>

<p id="section123"><b>123.</b> The school to which Cicero finally attached himself
was that founded by <span class="smcap">Antiochus</span> of Ascalon (circ. 125-50 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
who under the name of the ‘old Academy’ taught doctrines
which were practically indistinguishable from those of the
diluted Stoicism which now prevailed, avoiding only the dogmatic
temper and a few of the paradoxes of the Stoics<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. This
appears to have been the prevailing tone of philosophical
discussion from the fall of the Republic to the death of Augustus.
Brutus (the ‘tyrannicide’), though family and political associations
have linked his name with that of Cato, was in his
philosophical opinions a follower of Antiochus<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Not very
different were probably the views of two teachers, nominally
Stoics, who held high positions in the household of Augustus.
<span class="smcap">Athenodorus</span> the younger of Tarsus (possibly the same as
the Athenodorus Calvus mentioned in the last section) was a
pupil of Posidonius, and whilst teaching at Apollonia counted
amongst his pupils Julius Caesar’s great-nephew Octavius, who
was afterwards to become the emperor Augustus. Octavius
took his teacher with him to Rome, and he had the credit of
exercising a restraining influence on his patron. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 30 he
was sent in his old age to reform the government of his native
city Tarsus. He appears to have written chiefly on popular
moral subjects<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. <span class="smcap">Areius Didymus</span> of Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, who was
for a longer period installed in the household of
Augustus<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, is of interest to us as the first of those
who made excerpts from the works of earlier writers, and to him we
owe most of the Stoic fragments found in the work of Stobaeus.
He probably depended in the first instance on the writings of
Antiochus of Ascalon. He was instrumental in saving his native
town Alexandria when taken by Augustus in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 30. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
probable enough that his ‘Epitome’ was prepared for the use of
Augustus, and provided the material for philosophical discussions
at the banquet, such as those to which Horace so often refers<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.
Seneca tells us that he was acquainted with the inmost thoughts
of the family of Augustus, and reports the language in which he
consoled Livia upon the death of her son Drusus<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 9). He
was succeeded by <span class="smcap">Theon</span> of Alexandria, also a Stoic, who took
a special interest in physiology.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attalus.</div>

<p id="section124"><b>124.</b> We know from Horace that in the time of Augustus
Stoic philosophers were found not only at the court, but also in
the public lecture-room, and at the street-corners. Such were
Stertinius<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, of whom the commentators say that he was the
author of 120 books on Stoicism<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>; Crispinus<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, said to have been
a bad poet<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>; and Damasippus<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. In Horace’s amusing sketches
we find the Stoic as he appeared to the unconverted. He has
sore eyes, or else a troublesome cough<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>; he presses his teaching
upon his hearers unreasonably and unseasonably. But in the
reign of Tiberius we find these popular lecturers held in very
high esteem. One of the most eminent was <span class="smcap">Attalus</span>, of whom
Seneca the philosopher gives us a glowing account.
Seneca was the first each day to besiege the door
of his school, and the last to leave through it. This philosopher
must have exercised an extraordinary influence over the young
men of his time. In his mouth the paradox ‘the wise man is a
king’ seemed a modest statement; his pupils were half disposed
to regard him as a god<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. When he declaimed on the misery of
human life, a deep pity for their fellow-men fell upon them;
when he extolled poverty, they felt disposed to renounce their
wealth; when he recommended the simple life, they readily
abandoned the use of meat and wine, of unguents and of warm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
baths<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. Seneca quotes from him in full an address on the vanity
of wealth, which shews his teaching to be very similar to that of
the more famous Musonius<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. He attached a special value to
the discipline which hardships bring with them<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. He incurred
the dislike of Seianus, who defrauded him of his property and
reduced him to the position of a peasant<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cornutus.</div>

<p id="section125"><b>125.</b> Our attention is next attracted by <span class="smcap">L. Annaeus
Cornutus</span> (circ. 20-66 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), who was born in
Africa, and entered the house of the Annaei, presumably
as a slave. There he received his freedom, and became
the teacher of the two poets Persius and Lucan; of these the
former has left us an attractive account of his personality<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. He
wrote in Greek, and one of his works, ‘On the Nature of the
Gods,’ is still extant. This book is a development of the system
which we see followed by Cicero in the <i>de Natura deorum</i> (based
upon Posidonius), by which a reconciliation is effected between
the Stoic physics and the popular mythology. By means of
etymology and allegory, all that is incredible or offensive in the
old legends of the gods is metamorphosed into a rationalistic
explanation of the phenomena of the universe. Thus Zeus is
the soul of the universe, because he is the cause of life in all
living things, Zeus being derived from ζῆν ‘live.’ Apollo is the
sun, and Artemis the moon: Prometheus the providence that
rules in the universe. Pan is the universe. Cronos consumes
all his offspring except Zeus, for time consumes all except what
is eternal. Hera, the air (Ἥρα from ἀήρ) is sister and wife of
Zeus, because the elements of fire and air are intimately associated.
The popularity of such a treatise goes far to explain
to us the close connexion now becoming established between
the Stoic philosophy and the practices of Roman religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Seneca.</div>

<p id="section126"><b>126.</b> Roughly contemporary with Annaeus Cornutus, but
perhaps rather older, was the famous Latin writer
<span class="smcap">L. Annaeus Seneca</span> (circ. 4 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>-65 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). Born in
Corduba in Spain, he may have inherited simple tastes from his
provincial origin; but it was the eloquence of Attalus which
moved him to a deliberate choice of the philosophic life<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. Under
this influence he was at one time tempted to throw away his
wealth; whilst the Pythagorean philosopher Sotion induced him
to become for a time a vegetarian<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. To the end of his days he
adhered to the ‘simple life’; he felt an aversion to wine, oysters,
and all luxurious food; he discarded hot baths and soft chairs
as debilitating; and of perfumes he would have only the best,
that is, none at all<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. He was an ardent lover of books, and
appears to us as the last Roman who made a systematic study
of Stoicism in the original authorities, and thus grasped the
system in its full extent. He did not however claim, like his
teacher Attalus, to be a wise man; far from that, he laments
that he is still in the deep waters of wickedness<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. In an age
when a governmental career was freely open to talent, Seneca’s
powers and industry carried him to high political station, and
greatly increased his inherited wealth. He played a part in the
court of Claudius, and in time became the tutor, and ultimately
the minister, of Nero. He did not possess the zeal of a reformer,
and doubtless tolerated many an abuse, and often bowed his
head before power even when linked with tyranny<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. But if he
did not imitate the unbending stiffness of Cato, we have still no
reason to credit the personal calumnies that pursued him at
court. Had his career as a whole been a discredit to his philosophical
profession, we may feel sure that Juvenal would never
have overlooked so sensational a contrast. For the last few
years of his life he resigned political power, that he might devote
himself to what he deemed a more important task, the exposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
of the practical teaching of Stoicism<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. Finally he was, or appeared
to be, drawn into a plot against the emperor, and was
called upon in consequence to put an end to his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His style.</div>

<p id="section127"><b>127.</b> The literary style of Seneca was severely criticized
by critics almost contemporary with him. Gellius
tells us that in his time it was by many not thought
worth while to read his writings, because the style was found
to be vulgar, the matter characteristic of half-educated men,
the argument petty and exaggerated<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. Quintilian finds that
much of his work is admirable, but much also is tainted by a
striving for cheap effect and a want of solid knowledge<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>; and
he thinks him in no way comparable to Cicero<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. This judgment
is generally maintained in the world of modern scholarship,
with the result that Seneca’s works are not read in our schools
and universities, and are little known even to professional
scholars. On the other side we may set the extraordinary
popularity of Seneca both in his own times<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and in those of
the Renascence. It is possible to argue that his style represents
the true tendency of the Latin language in his day, and that it
is in the direct line towards the modern style of French prose,
generally considered the best in the world. As regards his
matter it is not possible to deny that he repeats the same moral
teaching many times in slightly altered form<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, and that he
seldom gives us a continuous or thorough treatment of any
important subject<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. His writings may well be compared with
articles in our periodical literature and the hebdomadal productions
of our pulpits; they aim at immediate effect rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
than at the slow building up of ordered knowledge. Just for
that reason they admirably illustrate for us Stoicism in its
practical application to daily life; and the extraordinary
popularity which they enjoyed for many centuries seems to
shew that they are in touch with deeply-rooted instincts of
humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His independence.</div>

<p id="section128"><b>128.</b> Seneca claims to be an independent thinker, only
adopting the views of Stoic masters because their
arguments convince him<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. Still he does not use
the liberty he claims to assert any new principles, but only to
deviate occasionally in the direction of popular views. Thus
he frequently adopts some dogma of Epicurus or some Cynic
paradox to point a moral, and appears unconscious of the deep-lying
differences which keep these schools apart from Stoicism;
and only in reply to some challenge does he state with any
care the Stoic position. This is particularly the case with the
problem of wealth, which both Epicurean and Cynic disparage,
but the true Stoic is called upon to defend as a ‘thing of high
degree.’ Yet when Seneca is called upon to defend his own
possession of wealth he states his case with admirable clearness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakening of Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section129"><b>129.</b> It is perhaps partly due to his style that it appears
at times as if Seneca’s hold on Stoic doctrine was
often weak. He has no real belief in conviction
and scientific knowledge: ‘if we try to be exact everywhere,
we shall need to keep silence; for there is something to be said
against most statements<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.’ For the detailed Stoic system of
logic he feels only contempt<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. In physics however his interest
is keen, probably under the influence of his favourite Posidonius:
he sets forth with great clearness the theory of tone (τόνος,
<i>intentio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>: he eloquently maintains the existence of gods,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
abandoning the traditional proofs, and basing his conviction
upon the moral sense in man<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>: he holds firmly to the doctrine
of the conflagration<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. Still we have constant reason to doubt
whether these beliefs are linked together in his mind by any
consistent principle. His ethics are marked by a similar weakness:
the Socratic ‘strength and force’ is wanting, and is
replaced by a spirit of quietism and resignation. The important
position which he has filled in Roman politics awakens no
enthusiasm in himself, nor does the greatness of the Roman
empire excite his admiration. His heart is in his books; to
them he gives up entirely his closing years. His wise man
will not go out of the way to mix in politics; rather he will
carefully consider how he may avoid the dangers of social
strife<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. This enfeebled moral teaching is found also in the
successors of Seneca, and in modern literature is constantly
quoted as true Stoic doctrine. But though Seneca’s philosophy
finds him many an excuse for his retirement, he would have
been a more faithful disciple of Zeno and Cleanthes if he had
borne the burden of public life to the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Musonius.</div>

<p id="section130"><b>130.</b> To the same period as Seneca belongs <span class="smcap">C. Musonius
Rufus</span>, in whom however we observe distinctly,
what we may conjecture had also been the case
with Attalus, that ethical teaching is becoming divorced from
philosophical theory, and so the Cynic standpoint approached.
Musonius was a preacher with a singular impressiveness of
address. Speaking from the heart on matters of direct moral
import, he won respect even from those who were least willing to
be guided by him. He disdained the applause of his hearers,
desiring instead to see each one tremble, blush, exult, or stand
bewildered according as the address affected him<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. ‘If you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
have leisure to praise me,’ he said to his pupils, ‘I am speaking to
no purpose.’ ‘Accordingly,’ said one of them, ‘he used to speak
in such a way that every one who was sitting there supposed
that some one had accused him before Rufus: he so touched
on what was doing, he so placed before the eyes every man’s
faults<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.’ Amongst his pupils were Aulus Gellius the antiquarian,
Epictetus, and a certain Pollio who made a collection
of his sayings (ἀπομνημονεύματα Μουσωνίου), of which extracts
have been preserved for us by Stobaeus. They consist of moral
maxims (χρεῖαι) such as ‘Live each day as if your last<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>,’
‘Nothing is more pleasurable than temperance<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>,’ and discourses
or ‘diatribes’ (διατριβαί) dealing with subjects such as
discipline, endurance, marriage, obedience to parents, and so
forth<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. In elevation of standard these writings stand higher
than those of the early Stoics; and the influence of Musonius
was so great that we may almost regard him as a third founder
of the philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His part in politics.</div>

<p id="section131"><b>131.</b> In public life Musonius played a conspicuous part;
he was the Cato of his generation, trusted by all
parties for his absolute rectitude of character, and
respected for his fearlessness; but he was much less out of
touch with the real conditions of the Roman world. When in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 62 Rubellius Plautus found himself unable to quiet Nero’s
suspicions of his loyalty, it was believed that Musonius encouraged
him to await his end calmly, rather than attempt
rebellion<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. After the conspiracy of Piso, Musonius was
banished from Rome by Nero, together with most of the
eminent personalities of the capital<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. On Nero’s death he
returned to Rome, and when the armies of Vespasian and
Vitellius were fighting in the suburbs of the city, the senate
sent delegates to propose terms of peace. Musonius joined
them, and ventured to address the common soldiers, expatiating
on the blessings of peace, and sternly reproving them
for carrying arms. He was roughly handled and forced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
desist. Tacitus speaks severely of this unseasonable display
of philosophy<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>; and certainly Rome would not have been the
gainer if the issue had remained undecided<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. But that such
an attempt was possible in defiance of all military discipline
speaks much both for the courage of the speaker and for the
respect in which his profession was held. Musonius continued
to play an honourable part in public life during the reign of
Vespasian, and retained the confidence of the emperor even at
a time when his advisers secured his assent to a measure for
expelling other philosophers from the capital<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Euphrates and Dio.</div>

<p id="section132"><b>132.</b> In the reigns of Titus and his successors pupils and
converts of Musonius played not inconspicuous parts
in public life. Amongst them was one <span class="smcap">Euphrates</span>,
of Tyre or Epiphania (circ. 35-118 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), who in his day won
all hearts and convinced all judgments. ‘Some persons,’ says
Epictetus, one of his fellow-pupils, ‘having seen a philosopher,
and having heard one speak like Euphrates—and yet who can
speak like him?—wish to be philosophers themselves<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.’ Pliny
made his acquaintance in his native land, and was filled with
affection for the man. He found his style dignified and sublime;
but especially he noticed its sweetness, which attracted even his
opponents. His personal appearance was even more charming;
he was tall, handsome, and the proprietor of a long and venerable
beard. His private life was beyond reproach, and he was devoted
to the education of his family of two sons and one daughter<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.
He appears to have completely achieved the reconciliation of
philosophy with worldly success.</p>

<p>More ascetic in temper was <span class="smcap">Dio</span> of Prusa (circ. 40-117 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>),
who was first an opponent but afterwards a follower of
Musonius<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. A Stoic in theory, a Cynic in practice, he assumed
the shabby cloak, and wandered as a physician of souls. His
eloquence succeeded in calming a mutiny of soldiers which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
followed on the death of Domitian, and won for him from a
following generation the title of the ‘golden-mouthed.’ He was
held in high honour both by Nerva and by Trajan. A large
number of his harangues are still extant.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Epictetus.</div>

<p id="section133"><b>133.</b> The influence of such teachers was at any rate widespread,
and if we suspect that Stoicism was already
losing its intensive force as it extended the sphere
of its influence, in this it did but obey what we shall see to be
its own law of creative activity<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. We still have to consider
the two teachers who are of all the most famous and the most
familiar; not however because they most truly express the
substance of Stoicism, but because they have most deeply
touched the feelings of humanity. These are <span class="smcap">Epictetus</span>
of Hierapolis (circ. 50-130 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) and Marcus Aurelius, who
later succeeded to the principate. The contrast between their
positions has often excited comment, since Epictetus was
born a slave, and only obtained his freedom in mature years,
that is, after the death of Nero in 68 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> In reality it is
characteristic of the times that so many men of foreign and
even servile origin rose to positions of eminence and became
the associates and teachers of men of high official rank. In
the great slave households, in particular, of imperial Rome
unequalled opportunities lay open to talent; the ‘educational
ladder’ was everywhere set up to encourage the youth to
make the best of his gifts. Further, just as young nobles were
frequently enamoured of slave girls, so far superior to the ladies
of their own class in wit, gentleness of manners, and loyalty in
the face of all terrors and temptations<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>; so their elders found
a delight in the company of the thoughtful and intellectual men
who came to the front through the competition of the slave
schools. Thus the emperor Claudius chose his ministers amongst
his freedmen, provoking thereby the sneers of the Roman aristocracy,
but greatly advancing the good government of the
Roman empire; and it was Epaphroditus, himself a freedman
of Nero, who sent the young Epictetus to study at the feet of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Musonius Rufus. Epictetus was a man of warm feelings and
clear head; his addresses, recorded for us by his hearer Arrian,
serve admirably to stimulate the domestic virtues and to keep
alive the religious spirit; but his teaching lacks the force which
befits the training of a statesman or a king. In logic he inclines
too much to suspense of judgment, in ethics to resignation.
But he did not altogether miss the Socratic force: in his youth
he had gone about inquiring of his neighbours if their souls
were in good health, and even when they replied ‘What is this
to you, my good man? Who are you?’ he had persisted in giving
trouble. Only when they raised their hands and gave him
blows had he recognised that there was something wanting in
his method<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. Other young philosophers, he felt, lacked this
energy, and were men of words, not deeds<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. Like other
philosophers, he was expelled from Rome by Domitian in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 89, when he retired to Nicopolis; there he gave lectures
till the time of his death<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His Cynism.</div>

<p id="section134"><b>134.</b> Epictetus was a vigorous opponent of the group of
young philosophers who delighted to display their
talent upon the intricacies of the Stoic logic, and
in his early youth he was taken to task by his teacher Musonius
for underrating this part of philosophy<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. He came however to
see the great importance of a thorough training in the methods
of reasoning, so that in practical life a man should distinguish
the false from the true, as he distinguishes good coins from bad.
In physics he lays stress chiefly on theology, and the ‘will of
God’ fills a large place in his conception of the government of
the world. In his treatment of practical ethics he makes free
use of illustrations from the social life of his own day: he finds
examples of Socratic strength in the athlete and the gladiator;
and he makes it clear that the true philosopher is not (as many
believe the Stoics to hold) a man devoid of natural feeling, but
on the contrary affectionate and considerate in all the relations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
of life. He has a special respect for the Cynic, who appears in
his lectures not as the representative of a differing philosophical
system, but as philanthropist, teacher, comforter, and missionary.
There is indeed in the addresses of Epictetus a complete fusion
of Stoicism with Cynism; and we trace in them pictures not
only of the Cynic system as a whole, but also of individual
teachers like Antisthenes and Diogenes, profoundly different
from and much more human than the representations of them
familiar through other literature; they are in fact pictures of
Cynic teachers passed down or idealized by the members of
their own sect. By their side stand the pictures of Ulysses the
sage and Heracles the purger of the world, as they must have
been described from generation to generation by Cynic orators
to their hearers amongst the poor and the unhappy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrian.</div>

<p id="section135"><b>135.</b> In the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the professed teachers of
Stoicism must have been very numerous; with
the death of Domitian persecution had passed
away. The philosophers were everywhere held in high esteem,
and in turn their whole influence was used in support of the
existing state of society and the official religion. In the early
part of the century <span class="smcap">Flavius Arrianus</span> (circ. 90-175 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>)
is the most eminent of Stoics; and it was noted that his relation
to his teacher Epictetus much resembled that of Xenophon to
Socrates. To him we owe the publication of the ‘discourses’
(διατριβαί) which he heard Epictetus deliver. In <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 124,
when lecturing at Athens, he won the favour of the emperor
Hadrian, and was appointed by him to high public offices, in
which he shewed himself a wise administrator and a skilful
general; in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 130 he received the consulship; and later he
withdrew to his native town of Nicomedia in Bithynia, where he
filled a local priesthood and devoted himself to the production
of works on history and military tactics. To Stoic doctrine he
made no direct contribution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rusticus.</div>

<p>After Arrian had given up the teaching of philosophy for
public life <span class="smcap">Q. Junius Rusticus</span> succeeded to the
position he left vacant. To him, amongst other
teachers belonging to various philosophical schools, was entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the education of the future emperor M. Aurelius, who gives us
the following picture of the teaching he received:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘From Rusticus, I first conceived the need of moral correction and
amendment; renounced sophistic ambitions and essays on philosophy,
discourses provocative to virtue, or fancy portraitures of the sage or the
philanthropist; learned to eschew rhetoric and poetry and fine language;
not to wear full dress about the house, or other affectations of the kind; in
my letters to keep to the simplicity of his own, from Sinuessa, to my mother;
to be encouraging and conciliatory towards any one who was offended or
out of temper, at the first offer of advances upon their side. He taught me
to read accurately, and not to be satisfied with vague general apprehension;
and not to give hasty assent to chatterers. He introduced me to the memoirs
of Epictetus, presenting me with a copy from his own stores<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>In Rusticus we may confidently trace a successor of the school
of Musonius and Epictetus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marcus Aurelius.</div>

<p id="section136"><b>136.</b> <span class="smcap">M. Aurelius Antoninus Pius</span> (121-180 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) is
commonly spoken of as ‘the philosopher upon
the throne,’ but this description may be misleading.
Aurelius was in the first instance a Roman prince; to the
institutions of Rome and to his own position as their chief
representative he owed his chief allegiance. He was undoubtedly
an apt pupil of the courtly philosophers by whom
he was surrounded; he deliberately chose philosophy in preference
to rhetoric, and of the various schools of philosophy
his judgment ranked Stoicism highest. He was fairly well
instructed, but by no means learned, in its doctrines; he
adhered with sincerity, but without ardour, to its practical
precepts. In the leisure hours of a busy life it was his comfort
and his relaxation to express his musings in the form of
philosophic reflections. But his attitude towards Stoicism is
always that of a judge rather than that of an advocate; and
much that the school received as convincing reasoning he rejected
as ingenious pleading. Hence a large part of Stoic doctrine,
and almost the whole of its detailed instruction, disappears from
his view; but we have the advantage that the last of the Stoic
writers brings out into clearer relief those features of this
philosophy which could still rivet attention in his own time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
and which therefore form part of the last message of the ancient
world to the coming generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His belief in the cosmos.</div>

<p id="section137"><b>137.</b> It follows at once from the judicial attitude of Marcus
Aurelius that he cannot countenance the Stoic
claim to certainty of knowledge. The objection
of opponents that the wise man, who alone (according to Stoic
theory) possesses such knowledge, is nowhere to be found, is
sustained:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Things are so wrapped in veils, that to gifted philosophers not a few
all certitude seems unattainable. Nay to the Stoics themselves such attainment
seems precarious; and every act of intellectual assent is fallible; for
where is the infallible man<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>?’</p>

</div>

<p>Yet Aurelius does not relapse into scepticism. One doctrine
at least is so convincing that he cannot for a moment doubt it;
it does after all shine forth as true by its own light. It is that
all things are ultimately one, and that man lives not in a chaos,
but in a cosmos:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘All things intertwine one with another, in a holy bond; scarce one thing
is disconnected from another. In due coordination they combine for one
and the same order. For the world-order is one made out of all things, and
god is one pervading all, and being is one, and law is one, even the common
reason of all beings possessed of mind, and truth is one: seeing that truth
is the one perfecting of beings one in kind and endowed with the same
reason<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>From the belief in a cosmos he is led on to a trust in Providence;
theoretically, because the doctrine of the chance clashing of
atoms is out of harmony with the belief in ultimate unity;
practically, because in such a conviction only man can find
a starting-point for his own activity. The choice is to him
all-important; either Fortune or Reason is king, and claims
allegiance from all.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Is it the portion assigned to you in the universe, at which you chafe?
Recall to mind the alternative—either a foreseeing providence, or blind
atoms—and all the abounding proofs that the world is as it were a city<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘The world is either a welter of alternate combination and dispersion,
or a unity of order and providence. If the former, why crave to linger on
in such a random medley and confusion? why take thought for anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
except the eventual “dust to dust”? why vex myself? do what I will, dispersion
will overtake me. But on the other alternative I reverence, I stand
steadfast, I find heart in the power that disposes all<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">His piety.</div>

<p id="section138"><b>138.</b> Aurelius makes full use of the Stoic proofs of the
existence of the gods, but it soon appears to us
that his attachment to the established religion was
not in any way founded upon philosophical arguments. In discussing
this point he displays a certain heat which we have not
yet had occasion to notice:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘If indeed they [the gods] take no thought for anything at all—an
impious creed—then let us have done with sacrifice and prayer and oaths,
and all other observances by which we own the presence and the nearness
of the gods<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Finally, he breaks away altogether from philosophy and rests
his convictions on personal experience:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘To those who press the question, “Where have you seen the gods,
whence your conviction of their existence, that you worship them as you
do?” I reply—first, they are visible even to the bodily eye; secondly,
neither have I set eyes upon my soul, and yet I do it reverence. So it is
with the gods; from my continual experience of their power, I have the
conviction that they exist, and yield respect<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>One further argument he held in reserve; the sword, the
cross, and the stake for the ‘atheists’ who refused to be
convinced. He was, after all, a king<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ethics.</div>

<p id="section139"><b>139.</b> In ethics, Aurelius states the main principles of
Stoicism with clearness; but he altogether ignores
the Stoic paradoxes, and does not trouble himself
with any detailed theory of the virtues and vices. Firmness
of character is to him the supreme good.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Be like the headland, on which the billows dash themselves continually;
but it stands fast, till about its base the boiling breakers are lulled to rest.
Say you, “How unfortunate for me that this should have happened”? Nay
rather, “How fortunate, that in spite of this, I own no pang, uncrushed by
the present, unterrified at the future!” The thing might have happened to
any one, but not every one could have endured it without a pang<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>But in spite of these doctrines, we trace throughout his pages
a tinge of melancholy. Too apt a pupil of Epictetus, he had
learnt from him the principles of submission and resignation,
but he had not acquired the joyous confidence of an older
period, through which the wise man, even if a slave, felt himself
a king. Rather, though a king, he felt himself in truth a slave
and a subject to the universe that was his master. He would
not go against the universal order, but he hardly felt the delight
of active cooperation. In this sense he represents to us the
decadence of Stoicism, or (to put it more correctly) Stoicism
coloured by the decadence of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absorption of the soul.</div>

<p id="section140"><b>140.</b> On the question of continued existence after death
Aurelius takes up and emphasizes the teaching of
Epictetus, ignoring the fact that other Stoic teachers,
from Zeno to Seneca, had taken larger views or at least allowed
themselves an ampler language. There had been, indeed, a
change in the point of view. The early Stoics, occupied with
the question of physics, had insisted upon the indestructibility
of substance, and the reuniting of the ‘spirit’ (πνεῦμα) with the
all-pervading spirit from which it came at the beginning. The
Roman school concerned itself more with the question of individuality
and personality. Accepting fully the principle that
that which is born must die, it comes to the definite conclusion
that that which we trace from the mother’s womb through
infancy and youth, through success and failure in life, through
marriage and the family ties onwards to weakness and dotage,
must reach its end in death. The ‘I’ cannot survive the body.
The future existence of the soul, if such there be, is no longer
(as with Seneca) a matter of joyful expectation, but of complete
indifference.</p>

<p>Epictetus had expressed this with sufficient clearness:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Death is a change, not from the state which now is to that which is not,
but to that which is not now. Shall I then no longer exist? You will not
exist, but you will be something else, of which the world now has need; for
you also came into existence, not when you chose, but when the world had
need of you<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Aurelius constantly repeats the doctrine in varied forms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘You exist but as a part inherent in a greater whole. You will vanish
into that which gave you being; or rather, you will be re-transmuted into
the seminal and universal reason<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘Death put Alexander of Macedon and his stable boy on a par. Either
they were received into the seminal principles of the universe, or were alike
dispersed into atoms<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Preparation for death.</div>

<p id="section141"><b>141.</b> The saddened outlook of Marcus Aurelius upon life
harmonizes well with the resignation with which
he contemplates a death, which for himself individually
will be the end. Hence it is that his reflections so
often make the thought of death a guiding principle of ethics;
he who has learnt to look forward calmly to his last act has
learnt thereby to abide patiently all the troubles which postpone
it. Thus the last message of the princely philosopher, as of his
predecessor, is that men should ‘bear and forbear’:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Contemn not death, but give it welcome; is not death too a part of
nature’s will? As youth and age, as growth and prime, as the coming of
teeth and beard and grey hairs, as begetting and pregnancy and the bearing
of children, as all other operations of nature, even such is dissolution.
Therefore the rational man should not treat death with impatience or
repugnance or disdain, but wait for it as one of nature’s operations<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘O for the soul ready, when the hour of dissolution comes, for extinction
or dispersion or survival! But such readiness must proceed from inward
conviction<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘Serenely you await the end, be it extinction or transmutation. While
the hour yet tarries, what help is there? what, but to reverence and bless
the gods, to do good to men, “to endure and to refrain”? and of all that
lies outside the bounds of flesh and breath, to remember that it is not yours,
nor in your power<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">His yearnings.</div>

<p id="section142"><b>142.</b> Aurelius was no teacher of Stoicism in his time: his
thoughts are addressed to himself alone<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. But
the happy accident that has preserved this work,
which for nine centuries was lost to sight<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, enables us to obtain
a view of this philosophy from which otherwise we should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
been shut out. We do not go to Aurelius to learn what Stoic
doctrine was; this is taken for granted throughout the book;
but we can see here how it affected a man in whom the intellectual
outlook was after all foreshortened by sympathies and
yearnings which had grown up in his nature. The traditional
criticism of the school as being harsh, unsympathetic, unfeeling,
breaks to pieces as we read these ‘thoughts’; rather we find
an excess of emotion, a surrender to human weakness. A study
of Stoicism based on the works of Aurelius alone would indeed
give us but a one-sided picture; but a study in which they were
omitted would certainly lack completeness. He is also our last
authority. In the centuries which succeeded, other waves of
philosophic thought washed over Stoicism, and contended in
turn with more than one religion which pressed in from the
East. Yet for a long time to come Stoic principles were faithfully
inculcated in thousands of Roman homes, and young men
taught in childhood to model their behaviour upon the example
of Zeno, Cleanthes, and Epictetus formed the salt of the Roman
world. If in riper years they joined, in ever increasing numbers,
the Christian church, they brought with them something which
the world could not afford to lose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parts of philosophy.</div>

<p id="section143"><b>143.</b> The history of Greek philosophy, even before the time
of Zeno, leads naturally to its division into the
three parts of logic, physics, and ethics<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. The Ionic
philosophers had chiefly occupied themselves with the nature and
history of the universe, that is, with the problems of physics.
The sophists were greatly concerned with questions as to the
validity of human knowledge, that is, with logic. Socrates
shared this interest, but attached greater importance to the
discussion of moral activities, that is, to ethics. It is however
not clear when a formal division into these three parts was
first made. Cicero attributes it to the immediate followers of
Plato in the Academic school; others assign it definitely to
Xenocrates<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. The Peripatetics and Stoics both adopted the
division, but whereas the former assigned to Logic an inferior
position, making it an introduction to philosophy, the Stoics
insist that it is a part of philosophy itself<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; and that of the
three parts it comes first in the order of study, ‘as in the measuring
of corn we place first the examination of the measure<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.’
It must not however be thought that the three parts of philosophy
can be separately treated, for they are intertwined<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; so
that in treating of Logic we shall constantly have need to
assume a general knowledge of Stoic views both on physics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and ethics. Logic is subdivided into ‘dialectic,’ which deals
with reasoning, and ‘rhetoric,’ the art of speech. The relation
between reason and speech was in ancient times, as now, a
matter of perplexity; but it may be taken as a fundamental
position of Stoicism that the two should always be in agreement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Knowledge is attainable.</div>

<p id="section144"><b>144.</b> Stoicism, as one of the positive and dogmatic schools,
assumes that knowledge is attainable. Since this
is the very point on which Socrates never reached
assurance, except on the one particular that he himself knew
nothing, it was a matter of primary importance to the Stoics
to make good this position; more especially since they held
(this time in agreement with Socrates) that virtue is but another
form of knowledge. Yet the Stoics could not agree with
the Cynics, that true knowledge can be imparted without a
study of its method<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Knowledge is, in their view, a high privilege
derived by man from his divine ancestry, and shared by
him with the deity alone; and the whole duty of man may
be summed up by saying that he should keep upright his
reason<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. They therefore devoted themselves with special zeal
to this part of philosophy<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, and were accordingly nicknamed
‘the dialecticians<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.’ Their aim in this was solely the ascertainment
and imparting of truth; but the common view that
their style was in consequence harsh and repellent will be found
to need considerable qualification<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Are the senses true?</div>

<p id="section145"><b>145.</b> The chief argument for the certainty of knowledge is
that we assume as much in the practical affairs of
life<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; and (as we have already seen) Aristo found
it ridiculous that his Academic neighbour should not even
know who he was<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Against it is the fact that men frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
disagree even as to what they see, and commonly distinguish
between what is known to them and what ‘seems’ to be this
or that. Hence Epictetus well defines the function of dialectic
as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘a perception of the disagreement of men with one another, and an
inquiry into the cause of this disagreement; a condemnation and distrust
of that which only seems, and some kind of investigation of that which
seems, as to whether it rightly seems: and the discovery of some rule
(κανών)<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Of all kinds of knowledge that which comes through the
senses appears to the ordinary man most worthy of confidence,
and of the five senses that of sight seems to the philosopher
the most divine<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. In consequence, the whole controversy
hinges on the question whether the eyes can be trusted. The
positivist argues that the evidence of sight is so plain and
unmistakeable that man, if he had the choice, could wish for
no better informant. The sceptic replies that nevertheless, if
a straight oar be placed partly in the water, it appears to the
eyes to be bent; and that the feathers on a dove’s neck, though
really alike, appear to the eyes as many-coloured<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. To deal
with such questions we must examine closely the nature of
sensation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Process of sensation.</div>

<p id="section146"><b>146.</b> The Stoics fancifully derive the word αἴσθησις (‘sensation’)
from εἴσθεσις (‘storage’); it is therefore,
strictly speaking, the process by which the mind is
stored<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; but it is also, from an opposite point of view, the
process by which the mind reaches out towards an external
object<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. From the object (αἰσθητόν) proceed waves which
strike upon the sense-organ (αἰσθητήριον); this impact is called
a ‘sensation’ in a narrower sense. At the same time there
proceeds from the mind (which is the ruling part or ‘principate’
of the soul), a ‘spirit’ or thrill which goes out to meet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
this impact; and this spirit and its operation are also called
‘sensation<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.’ As a result of the contact of these two waves,
and simultaneously with it, there is produced in the soul an
effect like the imprint of a seal<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, and this imprint is the
φαντασία or ‘mind-picture.’ That the process may be sound,
it is necessary that the intellect be in a healthy state, and
further that the organ of sense be healthy, the object really
there, and the place and the manner in accord<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. But we must
carefully distinguish between the single sensation and the mind-picture.
A flash of light, a cry, a touch, a smell, a thrill of pleasure
or pain, is always that which the senses declare it to be<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>;
here there is no possibility of error; so understood ‘the sensations
are always true<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.’ But if we go in each case a step
further; if we say ‘that is white,’ ‘this is sweet,’ ‘this is musical,’
‘this is fragrant,’ ‘that is rough,’ we are now dealing with mind-pictures,
not with ‘sensations’ in the strict sense<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. And as to
the mind-pictures we agree with the Academics that things are
not always what they seem; ‘of the mind-pictures some are
true, some are false<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The criterion of clearness.</div>

<p id="section147"><b>147.</b> In order then that we may distinguish the true mind-picture
from the false, we have need of a ‘rule’
(κανών) or ‘criterion’ (κριτήριον). The true mind-picture
is a stirring of the soul, which reveals both what is taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
place in the soul and the object which has caused this: just as
light reveals both itself and the objects that lie within its
range<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. On the other hand the false mind-picture is an empty
twitching of a soul which is not in a healthy condition<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; no
real object corresponds to it, but to that which appears to be
an object corresponding to it we give the name ‘phantasm<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.’
When Orestes thinks he sees the Furies leaping upon him,
though his sister assures him that in real truth he sees nothing,
the vision of the Furies is a phantasm. The appearances of
dreams are equally phantasms<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. Now a true mind-picture
differs from that of a phantasm by being clearer; or, in other
words, the distinctive note of a true mind-picture is its ‘clearness’
(ἐνάργεια, <i>perspicuitas</i>)<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Clearness then is a quality which
attaches itself to a true vision in a way in which it can never
attach itself to a work of phantasy<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. To this clearness the
mind cannot but bow<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; it is therefore (so far as our study has
proceeded) the criterion of truth<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Assent.</div>

<p id="section148"><b>148.</b> The mind-picture as such is not within a man’s control;
but it rests with him to decide whether he will give
it his ‘assent’ (συγκατάθεσις, <i>adsensio</i> or <i>adsensus</i>)<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
This assent is therefore an act of the soul, in its capacity
as will; and can only be rightly exercised by a soul properly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
strung, that is, possessed of due tension. Assent wrongly given
leads to ‘opinion’ (δόξα, <i>opinio</i>), and all wrong assent is error
or ‘sin’ (ἁμαρτία, <i>peccatum</i>). This error may take place in two
directions, either by a hasty movement of the will (προπίπτειν),
giving assent to a picture which is not really clear; or by feebleness
of will, which leads to assent in a false direction (διαψεύδεσθαι)<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.
Even haste however is a form of weakness, so that we
may say that all opining is a weak form of assent<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. To ensure
a right assent due attention should be given to each of its parts;
it includes (i) the intention of mastering the object (πρόθεσις);
(ii) careful attention directed to the object, or ‘application’
(ἐπιβολή); and (iii) assent in the narrower sense<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. Apart from
assent, three courses remain open: these are (i) ‘quiescence’
(ἡσυχάζειν, <i>quiescere</i>): (ii) ‘suspense of judgment’ (ἐπέχειν, <i>adsensum
sustinere)</i>, which is a settled quiescence; and (iii) negation<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comprehension.</div>

<p id="section149"><b>149.</b> Close upon assent follows ‘comprehension’ (κατάληψις,
<i>comprehensio</i>): this is the ratification of the
assent given, the fixing irrevocably in the mind of
the picture approved. This picture now becomes a ‘comprehension-picture’
(καταληπτικὴ φαντασία), and as such a unit of
knowledge. We may understand thereby that the mind has
grasped the external object<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, and this is the plain meaning of
Zeno’s simile; or we may say that the object has gained a hold
upon the mind, and has left its stamp upon it. Both interpretations
are consistent with Stoic doctrine: but the former view,
which represents the soul as active and masterful, undoubtedly
expresses the more adequately the meaning of the school<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
From this mutual grasp there follows an important physical
deduction. Since only like can grasp like, the soul must be
like the object, and the popular dualism of mind and matter
is (to this extent) at an end<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. Still this likeness is not complete;
and the soul in sensation does not grasp the object from
every point of view, but only so far as its own nature permits
in each case<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. For this reason the trained observer and the
artist grasp far more of the object than the ordinary man<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From sensation to reason.</div>

<p id="section150"><b>150.</b> The soul, having grasped single mind-pictures, retains
its hold upon them by memory<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>; the frequent
exercise of which keeps each picture fresh and
complete<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. As the air, when an orchestra is performing, receives
the impression of many sounds at the same time, and yet retains
the distinctive tone of each<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, so the soul by concurrent alterations
of its texture preserves its hold on the separate pictures
it has once grasped. Fresh operations of soul now supervene.
First, from the comparison of many like pictures, comes ‘experience’
(ἐμπειρία, <i>experientia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>; out of other comparisons,
‘similitude’ (ὁμοιότης), as ‘Socrates’ from his portrait; and
‘analogy’ (ἀναλογία, <i>proportio</i>), as ‘the centre of the earth’ from
that of other spheres; ‘transference’ (μετάθεσις, <i>translatio</i>), as
‘eyes in the heart’; ‘composition’ (σύνθεσις, <i>compositio</i>), as ‘a
Hippocentaur’; ‘opposition’ (ἐναντίωσις, <i>transitio</i>), as ‘death’
from life; ‘deprivation’ (κατὰ στέρησιν), as ‘a cripple<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.’ All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
these are based on the general principle of likeness and unlikeness,
and may be summed up under the general heading of
‘reason’s work of comparison’ (<i>collatio rationis</i>)<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, or shortly,
of reason (λόγος)<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Sensation shews us the present only; but
reason brings the past and the future within our view, and points
out to us the workings of cause and effect<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perceptions and Conceptions.</div>

<p id="section151"><b>151.</b> With the mind-pictures (φαντασίαι, <i>visa</i>) which are
derived from sensation we may now contrast the
‘notions’ (ἔννοιαι, <i>notiones</i> or <i>intellegentiae</i>) which
are derived from the combination of sensation and
reasoning; the former correspond generally to ‘perceptions,’ the
latter to ‘conceptions’ in the language of modern philosophy<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.
But each of the Stoic terms is also used in a wider sense which
includes the other. The sensory pictures are inscribed upon
the mind as upon a blank sheet from birth upwards; in this
sense they may well be called ‘entries on the mind’ (ἔννοια
from ἐν νῷ)<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. On the other hand the conceptions may be called
‘rational mind-pictures’<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; quite as much as the sensory mind-pictures
they need the prudent assent of the will before they
become ‘comprehensions,’ when they are once more units capable
of entering into further combinations and becoming part
of scientific knowledge. If then for the sake of clearness we
use the modern terms, we may say that perceptions correspond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
generally to individual objects which have a real existence,
whilst conceptions correspond to classes of things, which (according
to the Stoics) have no real existence in themselves, but
only a sort of existence in our minds. Thus the ‘ideas’ of Plato
are all conceptions, subjectively but not objectively existent<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.
So far as our study has gone, all conceptions are based on perceptions:
therefore all the elements of knowledge either come
from sense and experience solely, or from sense and experience
combined with reasoning<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; and the most important reasoning
process is that comparison of like perceptions which in this
philosophy takes the place of induction<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preconceptions.</div>

<p id="section152"><b>152.</b> But even if all ‘conceptions’ are ultimately derived
from ‘perceptions,’ it does not follow that in each
particular case the mind commences <i>de novo</i> to
collect and shape its material. On the contrary, it is clear that
not only all practical life, but also all philosophy, takes for
granted a great many matters which are either allowed by
general consent, or at least assumed by the thinker; and these
matters are mostly of the nature of class-conceptions. If it is
stated that ‘the consul entered Rome in a chariot drawn by four
horses,’ we assume that the ideas expressed by ‘consul,’ ‘chariot,’
‘four,’ ‘horses,’ are matters of general consent, and we may go
on to assume that the person of the consul and the locality called
‘Rome’ are also already known to the speaker and his hearers.
The general term in the post-Aristotelian writers for such legitimate
assumptions is ‘preconception’ (πρόληψις, <i>anticipatio</i> or
<i>praesumptio</i>). The precise meaning of this term (of which the
invention is ascribed to Epicurus<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>) appears not to be always
the same. Most commonly the ‘preconception’ is a general
term or conception, and therefore to the Stoics it is one variety
of the ἔννοια; it is ‘a mental shaping, in accordance with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
man’s nature, of things general’<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. All such preconceptions are
foreshadowings of truth, especially in so far as they correspond
to the common judgment of mankind<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>; and the art of life consists
in correctly applying these presumptions to the particular
circumstances with which each individual man has to deal<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. If
the preconceptions are rightly applied, they become clearer by
use, and thus attain the rank of true knowledge by a process
of development or ‘unravelling’ (<i>enodatio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.</p>

<p>As to the nature of a preconception, there is a great difference
between Epicurus and the Stoics. Epicurus identifies all
the terms ‘preconception,’ ‘comprehension,’ ‘right opinion,’ ‘conception,’
and ‘general notion,’ and maintains that each of these
is nothing but memory of a sensation frequently repeated<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; the
Stoics however hold that preconceptions are established by the
mind<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, and (so far as they are common to all men) by the universal
reason. This difference is fundamental. Epicurus, as a
materialist in the modern sense, explains perception as a bodily
function, and ‘conceptions’ of every kind as mere echoes of such
bodily functions. The Stoics on the other hand recognise at
each stage the activity of mind, and this in increasing degree
as we proceed to the higher levels of thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Notions of inner growth.</div>

<p id="section153"><b>153.</b> We now approach the most critical point in the Stoic
theory of knowledge. Is it possible for man to
possess knowledge which is not derived, either
directly or indirectly, through the organs of sense? Such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
question cannot be answered by any appeal to single Stoic
texts; it needs an appreciation of the whole philosophic outlook,
and upon it depend the most vital principles of the system.
Let us then first consider, on the supposition that such knowledge
exists, what its nature is, what its content, and how it is
attained by individual men. Knowledge cut off from the sense-organs
is cut off from all human individuality; it is therefore
the expression of the common reason (κοινὸς λόγος), and its
parts are ‘common notions’ (κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι or προλήψεις), shared
by gods and men, but by men only so far as they are partakers
of the divine nature. The principal content of such knowledge
is also clear; it includes the conception of what is morally good,
and the beliefs that gods exist and that the world is governed
by their providence<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Lastly, as of all general conceptions, the
rudiments or rough outlines only of these beliefs are inborn in
men, by virtue of their divine ancestry; whence they are called
‘innate notions’ (ἔμφυτοι ἔννοιαι, <i>insitae notiones</i>)<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. These
notions in their full development are not attainable by children
at all, nor by men till they attain to reason, that is, till they
become wise men<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Proofs’ of inborn notions.</div>

<p id="section154"><b>154.</b> The Stoics are naturally reluctant to admit that doctrines
which it is impious to deny are nevertheless
unattainable except by perfect wisdom; but their
whole system points inevitably to this conclusion. But there
are intermediate stages between the rough inborn outlines of
these truths and their ripe completeness. As man grows in
reason, he becomes increasingly able to appreciate contributory
truths, derived from the combination of perception and reasoning,
that is, by processes such as ‘analogy’ and ‘comparison,’
which point in the direction of the supreme beliefs. In this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
sense, and (it is here suggested) in this sense only, can there
be ‘proofs’ (ἀποδείξεις) of these<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Only in the crowning moment
of that probation which is described later on, at the moment of
conversion, these truths finally flash forth, stirred up indeed by
secondary evidence, but really rooted in the man’s deepest
nature<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; they then reveal themselves to the soul with an illuminating
power which is all their own, but which carries with
it the most complete conviction. Ordinary men must meanwhile
somehow make shift with reflections or pale copies of this
knowledge, to which however the name of common or inborn
notions can also be applied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inward touch.</div>

<p id="section155"><b>155.</b> The list of ‘common notions’ is doubtless not limited
to the high philosophical principles which we have
mentioned; for instance it must include such mathematical
principles as ‘two and two make four,’ ‘a straight line is
the shortest distance between two points,’ ‘a three-sided figure
has three angles,’ and so forth. With these however we have
little direct concern. Of more interest to us is another kind of
perception<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> recognised by the Stoics as well as by other schools
of philosophy, that called the ‘inward touch’ (ἐντὸς ἁφή)<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. By
this the soul becomes aware of its own workings, most obviously
of its pleasure and pain. The doctrine of the ‘inward touch’ is
of great philosophical importance, for it breaks down the dualism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of subject and object, the barrier between the knowing and the
known. Since these are the same in the specific cases named,
the door is open to the conclusion that everywhere there is a
kinship between the two, and that without this knowledge would
be without firm foundation. By this kinship we may also explain
the fact that direct communications are made by the deity
to man, as by dreams, oracles and augury<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Knowledge; the parts and the whole.</div>

<p id="section156"><b>156.</b> Thus it appears that the elements of knowledge, according
to the Stoics, are sensations, perceptions,
conceptions or notions, and general or inborn
notions. As in the other parts of the Stoic
philosophy, we shall regard this fourfold division as indicating
generally the ground covered, and not as setting up definite
lines of demarcation. The same material may be analyzed from
other points of view, as for instance in the study of words, in
which we shall find a division into objects, statements, conditional
statements, and syllogisms. The elements may also be
combined in various ways. A combination or ‘system’ (σύστημα)
which is directed towards a useful or pleasurable object, such as
music or grammar, is called an ‘art’ (τέχνη, <i>ars</i>)<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; and arts are
attainable by ordinary men. The wise man, on the other hand,
is not necessarily acquainted with the several arts; his practice
is to ‘keep quiet’ when matters are discussed which require such
special knowledge. The combination of all knowledge in one
all-embracing system is ‘science’ (ἐπιστήμη, <i>scientia</i>); the only
science in the full sense is philosophy<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>; and in this system no
part can be at variance with any other part<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. The elements of
knowledge also acquire the character of science, when they are
found to be parts of this compacted system, and therefore incapable
of coming into conflict with any other part<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>; and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
particular we find the term ‘science’ predicated of comprehensions
which are firmly established and cannot be refuted by any
argument<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. In the language of Zeno’s simile, over the closed
fist that grasps the object is placed the other hand, keeping it
with firmness and assurance in its place<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>; or, to use a comparison
first suggested in ridicule of Stoicism, but which by the progress
of architectural skill has since then been made less damaging,
science is like a firm and immoveable building constructed upon
a shifting foundation<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. Finally ordinary men can reach comprehension,
but only the wise man can attain to science<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The criterion reviewed.</div>

<p id="section157"><b>157.</b> We revert to the difficult problem of the criterion of
truth, that is, the discovery of a rule by which the
true can separated from the false. Our authorities
differ greatly as to what the Stoic criterion is; and this
vacillation must have placed the Stoics at a great disadvantage
in their controversy with the Academics, who maintain that there
is no criterion. The most usual statement is that the ‘comprehensive
mind-picture’ (καταληπτικὴ φαντασία) is the criterion;
this view is expressly attributed to Chrysippus, Antipater, and
Apollodorus<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. As we have seen, the meaning of this is that
a true mind-picture can be distinguished from one that is false
by the note of clearness, and this general doctrine can be traced
back to Zeno<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. It appears at first sight to provide a criterion
which can be applied by the percipient at the moment when it
is needed, and it was doubtless intended to be a practical tool
in this sense; but under the pressure of criticism the Stoics were
frequently compelled to modify it. They could not but admit
that in the case of dreams and drunken visions it is only at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
a later moment that the lack of clearness can be appreciated<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>;
whereas on the other hand a picture may be perfectly clear, and
yet the percipient, because of some prepossession, may not realize
this. Such was the case when Hercules brought Alcestis from
the world below; her husband Admetus received a true mind-picture
of her, but put no confidence in it, because he knew her
to be dead. It follows that no mind-picture can be implicitly
trusted for itself; for our sense organs may be clouded, or our
previous experience in conflict with it. If the Academics
urged that the sure note of clearness is not to be found in the
senses<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>, the Stoics admitted as much when they now said that
a true comprehensive picture must come from a real object<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>,
when they added the words that ‘no objection must arise<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>’;
thus really admitting that it must be not only persuasive, but
also such as no reasoning process can shake, and such as has
been examined from all sides<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. Thus they shifted the centre
of certainty from the single comprehension to the general field
of science; they still held to it in theory, but no longer maintained
its practical application. For this too they had the
authority of the older masters. For we learn on the authority
of Posidonius that ‘some of the older Stoics’ held the true
criterion to be ‘right reason’ (ὀρθὸς λόγος)<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, and this is equivalent
to saying that only the deity and the wise man possess
the secret<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. In a loose sense any important part of the Stoic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
theory of reason may be said to be a criterion; thus Chrysippus
again said that ‘the criteria are sensation and preconception,’ and
Boethus set up many criteria, as mind, sense, science, and (in
practical matters) appetite<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General consent.</div>

<p id="section158"><b>158.</b> Seeing that the full assurance of truth is not at every
moment attainable, it is necessary to be contented
from time to time with something less complete.
Amongst such tests the ‘general consent of mankind’ plays
an important part, especially in connexion with the dogma
‘that gods exist.’ We may indeed well believe that this criterion
was not originally suggested by revolutionary philosophers,
but rather by conservative advocates of an established religion;
and therefore we are not surprised to see it emphasized first by
Posidonius and afterwards by Seneca<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. General consent is
however by itself no proof of truth, but at most an indication
of the presence of a ‘common notion’ in its rough shape. If
however we see that the ‘common notion’ grows stronger
and more clear every day, and if it is the more firmly held as
men approach the standard of wisdom, it becomes a strong
support<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Probability the guide of life.</div>

<p id="section159"><b>159.</b> From a very early period, as we have already indicated,
Stoic teachers accepted probability as the
guide of life in its details, being perhaps aided by
the happy ambiguity of the expression ‘reasonableness’
(τὸ εὔλογον), which suggests formally the pursuit of reason,
but in practice is a justification of every course of which a
plausible defence can be brought forward. Ptolemy Philopator,
we are told, jestingly put wax fruit before Sphaerus at his table,
and when Sphaerus tried to eat it cried out that he was giving
his assent to a false mind-picture. Sphaerus replied that he had
not assented to the picture ‘this is fruit,’ but only to the picture
‘this is probably fruit<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.’ Antipater of Tarsus, when he explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
that the very essence of virtue lay in the choice of natural
ends upon probable grounds<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, was felt to be giving way to
Carneades<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. Panaetius justified the maintaining of that which
is plausible by the advocate, and Cicero, whose own conscience
was not at ease in the matter, was glad enough to quote so
respectable an authority on his own behalf<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. In the Roman
imperial period a growing spirit of humility and pessimism led
to a general disparagement of human knowledge, centring in
attacks on the trustworthiness of the senses. So Seneca speaks
of the ‘usual weakness’ of the sense of sight<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, and Marcus
Aurelius feels that ‘the organs of sense are dim and easily
imposed upon<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.’ The older Stoics had admitted the frequent
errors of the senses<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, but they had been confident they could
surmount this difficulty. Their latest disciples had lost the
courage to do this, and in consequence the practice of ‘suspension
of judgment,’ which before had been the exception<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, became
with them the rule. Nevertheless Epictetus, who alone amongst
these later Stoics was an ardent student of dialectics, held fast to
the main principle that certainty is attainable. ‘How indeed’ he
said ‘perception is effected, whether through the whole body or
any part, perhaps I cannot explain, for both opinions perplex
me. But that you and I are not the same, I know with perfect
certainty<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grammar.</div>

<p id="section160"><b>160.</b> Having now dealt with the theory of knowledge, we
may consider briefly the subordinate sciences (or
rather ‘arts’) of Grammar, Logic (in the narrower
sense), and Style. Here we may leave the technical divisions
and subdivisions of the Stoics; for these matters are substantially
independent of the main lines upon which the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
philosophies parted company, and have for us only a secondary
and historical interest. The Stoics distinguish five parts of
speech: ‘name’ (ὄνομα, <i>nomen</i>), as ‘Diogenes’; ‘class-name’
(προσηγορία, <i>appellatio</i>), as ‘man, horse’<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>; ‘verb’ (ῥῆμα, <i>verbum</i>);
‘conjunction’ (σύνδεσμος, <i>coniunctio</i>); and ‘article’ (ἄρθρον, <i>articulus</i>).
The last they define naïvely as a little word which is
all ending, and serves to distinguish the cases and numbers<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.
To the list of the parts of speech Antipater added the ‘mixed
part’ or participle (μεσότης). The noun has four cases (πτώσεις),
the ‘upright case’ (πτῶσις εὐθεῖα, <i>casus rectus</i>; this is of course
a contradiction in terms); and the ‘oblique’ cases (πλάγιαι),
that is the ‘class’ case (γενική), the ‘dative’ (δοτική), and the
‘effect’ case (αἰτιατική). The ῥῆμα or verb is identical with
the κατηγόρημα or ‘predicate,’ and may take the ‘active’ form
(ὀρθά), the ‘passive’ (ὕπτια), or the ‘neuter’ (οὐδέτερα); some
verbs also express action and reaction, and are called ‘reflexive’
(ἀντιπεπονθότα). The Stoics also distinguished the tenses.
Time (χρόνος) being of three kinds, past (παρῳχημένος), present
(ἐνεστώς), and future (μέλλων), we have the following tenses
which are ‘definite’ (ὡρισμένοι): the ‘present imperfect’ (ἐνεστὼς
ἀτελής), the ‘past imperfect’ (παρῳχημένος ἀτελής), the ‘present
perfect’ (ἐνεστὼς τέλειος), and the ‘past perfect’ (παρῳχημένος
τέλειος); in addition to these we have the ‘indefinite’ tenses, the
future (μέλλων), and the past indefinite, called simply indefinite
(ἀόριστος)<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Theories of speech.</div>

<p id="section161"><b>161.</b> So far we find in the Stoic system the general framework
of the grammar of the period, much of it
adapted with modifications from Aristotle. In
some other details points of real grammatical or philosophical
interest are raised. Such is the controversy between ‘anomaly,’
the recognition of the individuality of each word in its flexion,
and ‘analogy,’ in which the validity of the rules of declension
and conjugation is insisted upon. Two Stoic masters, Chrysippus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and Crates of Mallos, took up the cause of ‘anomaly<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.’ Further
the Stoics held that all correct language exists by nature (φύσει),
and not by convention (θέσει), as Aristotle had maintained;
the elements of language being imitations of natural sounds<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
Further, they held that the natural relation between ‘things’
(σημαινόμενα, <i>significata</i>) and the words that express them
(σημαίνοντα, <i>significantia</i>) can frequently be determined by
etymology; for instance φωνή ‘voice’ is φῶς νοῦ ‘the mind’s
lamp,’ αἰών ‘age’ is ἀεὶ ὄν ‘enduring for ever<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.’ Like Heraclitus
and Aristotle, the Stoics distinguished between ‘thought’
(λόγος ἐνδιάθετος, <i>ratio</i>) and ‘speech’ (λόγος προφορικός, <i>oratio</i>),
which the Greek word λόγος tends to confuse<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; thought is immaterial,
but speech, as consisting of air in motion, is body<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.
Young children and animals do not possess real speech, but only
‘a sort of speech<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Propositions and Syllogisms.</div>

<p id="section162"><b>162.</b> Words in combination form statements, questions,
wishes, syllogisms, and so forth<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>; there is therefore
no clear line drawn between what we call
syntax and logic respectively. Whenever we have
a complete combination of words expressing that which must
either be false or true, as ‘Hannibal was a Carthaginian,’ ‘Scipio
destroyed Numantia,’ we call it a ‘statement’ or ‘proposition’
(ἀξίωμα)<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; for phrases of all kinds we have the more general
term ‘phrase’ (λεκτόν, <i>id quod dicitur</i>)<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. Of special interest is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
the conditional sentence (συνημμένον), which has two parts, the
conditional clause (ἡγούμενον) and the contingent clause (λῆγον).
The conditional or leading clause always contains a sign
(σημεῖον), by means of which we reach proof: thus in saying
‘if it is day, it is light’ we mean that ‘day’ is a sign of light.
Proof is ‘speech on every subject gathering what is less clear
from that which is more clear<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.’ Its most important form is
the syllogism, of which Chrysippus recognises five forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>(i) if A, then B; but A, therefore B.</li>
<li>(ii) if A, then B; but not B, therefore not A.</li>
<li>(iii) not A and B together; but A, therefore not B.</li>
<li>(iv) either A or B; but A, therefore not B.</li>
<li>(v) either A or B; but not A, therefore B<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">All these matters admit of endless qualifications, subdivisions,
and developments, and were therefore serviceable to those Stoics
who were before all things makers of books<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. Examples of Stoic
syllogisms have been given above<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fallacies.</div>

<p id="section163"><b>163.</b> Closely connected with the theory of the syllogism is
the enticing subject of the ‘resolution of fallacies’
(σοφισμάτων λύσις), which the Megarians had
brought within the range of philosophy. To this subject the
Stoics gave much attention<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. The most famous fallacy is that
of the ‘heap’ (σωρίτης, <i>acervus</i>); ‘if two are few, so are three; if
three, then four; and so forth.’ In this Chrysippus took a special
interest<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>; his reply was to keep still<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. Another is the ‘liar’
(ψευδόμενος, <i>mentiens</i>); ‘when a man says “I lie,” does he lie
or not? if he lies, he speaks the truth; if he speaks the truth,
he lies<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.’ On this subject Chrysippus wrote a treatise, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
Epictetus thought not worth reading<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Seneca gives us examples
of other fallacies, which also are verbal quibbles<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. Of an
altogether different kind are those problems in which the question
of determinism as opposed to moral choice is involved. Such is
the ‘reaper,’ which maintains ‘either you will reap or you will
not reap; it is not correct to say “perhaps you will reap.”’
Such again is the ‘master-argument’ of Diodorus the Megarian,
directly aimed against every moral philosophy<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. These difficulties
we shall discuss later as touching the supreme problems
which are presented to the human reason<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definition.</div>

<p id="section164"><b>164.</b> The scientific study of syllogisms and fallacies promises
at first sight to be a guide to truth and a way of
escape from error, but experience shews it nevertheless
to be barren. It has however an advantage in securing
a careful statement of teaching, and for this purpose was much
used by Zeno and Chrysippus. The later members of the school
realized that this advantage could be more simply gained by
the practice of careful definition (ὅρος, <i>definitio</i>). Antipater thus
defined definition itself: ‘definition is an expression which elaborates
in detail without falling short or going too far<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.’ He
and all other Stoics of his time gave numerous definitions of the
most important terms used in the system, such as God, fate, providence,
the supreme good, virtue, and so forth; and these are of
great value in giving precision to their doctrine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Style.</div>

<p id="section165"><b>165.</b> In considering Style we first notice the distinction
between dialectic in the narrower sense, in which
statements are made in the shortest and most precise
form, and rhetoric, in which they are expanded at length<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.
Zeno compared one to the closed fist, the other to the open
palm<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. Both Cleanthes and Chrysippus wrote upon rhetoric,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
and it appears to have become a tradition to ridicule their
teaching, chiefly on the ground of the novel terms which the
Stoics introduced, as προηγμένα, κοσμόπολις<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. But it is exactly
in these new-fangled words that we observe one of the chief aims
of the Stoic theory of style, namely the use of words which
precisely and exclusively correspond to the objects described
(κυριολογία, <i>proprietas verborum</i>), and which therefore lead up
to transparent clearness of speech (σαφήνεια, <i>pellucida oratio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.
To this clearness the study of grammar is contributory; ‘barbarisms’
(faults in spelling and pronunciation) must be avoided,
with proper help from the doctrines of ‘anomaly’ and ‘analogy’;
for the Stoics learnt in time that neither of these is exclusively
true. Equally important is the avoidance of ‘solecisms,’ or faults
in syntax. In this way a pure use of language (Ἑλληνισμός,
<i>Latinitas</i>) is attained; this is largely based upon the example
of older writers, such as Homer in Greek, and Cato the elder in
Latin<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>, but not to such an extent as to employ words not commonly
intelligible. But little more is needed; the Stoic will say
what he has to say with ‘brevity’ (συντομία, <i>brevitas</i>); the graces
of style will be represented by ‘becomingness’ (πρέπον, <i>decorum</i>)
and ‘neatness’ (κατασκευή), the latter including euphony. These
virtues of speech are sufficient for speaking well, which is neither
more nor less than speaking truthfully<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>; for the Stoic needs
only to instruct his hearer, and will not lower himself either to
amuse him or to excite his emotions<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. Style has three varieties,
according as it is employed in the council, in the law-courts, or
in praise of goodness and good men<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>; in the last there was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
doubt greater room allowed for that expansiveness of speech
which the Stoics specially designated as ‘rhetoric.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoic orator.</div>

<p id="section166"><b>166.</b> The ‘Stoic style’ was a severe intellectual and moral
discipline. The speaker was called upon under all
circumstances to speak the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth. He could hold back nothing from
his audience, even though his words might be offensive to their
religious opinions, their patriotic feelings, or their sense of decency;
he could add no word which would touch their sympathies
or kindle their indignation in the direction he himself might
wish. He had always before his eyes the example of Socrates’
defence before the Athenian jury and its result. The Stoic
appeared before his audience as a brave, sane, and rather rugged
speaker, painfully ill-equipped in all those arts which the circumstances
demanded<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. Even the Stoics of the transition period,
in spite of their Academic leanings and their literary acquirements,
made this impression at Rome. Diogenes, who had
himself done much to elaborate the theory of style, was noted
as a quiet and self-restrained speaker<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. The influence of
Panaetius may be traced in his friend Lucilius, who in his
book on style is never tired of ridiculing the artifices of rhetoricians.
Then followed a succession of these reserved speakers,
which we shall trace in another chapter, leading up to Cato of
Utica, by far the best-known and the most ridiculed of them
all<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not easy to form a fair judgment of the merits of the
Stoic style. It must be admitted that the works of Chrysippus
are not readable; but on the other hand Antipater, Panaetius,
Posidonius, Musonius Rufus, and Epictetus were all writers or
speakers of great attractiveness<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paradox.</div>

<p id="section167"><b>167.</b> In connexion with style we may call attention to the
important function of paradoxes (παράδοξα, <i>inopinata</i>),
that is, propositions contrary to common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
opinion. Since all philosophies conflict with common opinion,
they must necessarily include many paradoxes<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. The chief
Stoic paradoxes are those which were borrowed directly from
the Cynic school, and indirectly from the teaching of Socrates<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>:
and Cicero devotes a special work to their defence. He includes
the following: (i) that only what is honourable is good; (ii) that
virtue is sufficient for happiness; (iii) that right actions and
offences are equal; (iv) that all foolish men are mad; (v) that
the wise man alone is free and every foolish man a slave; (vi)
that the wise man alone is rich. These of course include the
very pith and marrow of Stoic ethics; and the form is calculated
to arrest the attention of the crowd and to challenge defiantly its
cherished opinions. The Stoics of literary taste and social position
usually shew some distaste for paradoxes, and prefer to state
their teaching in ways more obviously reasonable. But it should
hardly be necessary to explain that no paradox is complete in
itself, but each needs to be interpreted according to the principles
of the school which propounds it. In proportion as the doctrines
of any school win general recognition, its paradoxes tend to find
ready acceptance, and may ultimately become truisms<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p>The treatment of myths as allegories<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> may also be considered
as the use of a kind of paradox; this we shall find it most convenient
to discuss in connexion with Stoic views upon the nature
of the gods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers of logic.</div>

<p id="section168"><b>168.</b> The study of logic is at first sight dismal and repulsive;
when progress has been made in it, it seems
illuminating; in the end it becomes so alluring,
that the would-be philosopher may easily be lost for ever in its
mazes<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. The early Stoics had pressed this discipline upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
their pupils; those of the Roman period, themselves (with the
exception of Epictetus) weak dialecticians, never cease to warn
their hearers against its fascinations. So Seneca tells us that
many logical inquiries have nothing to do with real life<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>; and
that the older Stoics had wasted much time over them<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>;
Epictetus complains that his hearers never get beyond the
resolving of syllogisms<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, and M. Aurelius thanks the gods that
he never wasted his time in this way<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoic and Academic logic.</div>

<p id="section169"><b>169.</b> It was a favourite contention of Cicero, adopted from
his teacher Antiochus, that the Stoic dialectic was
no original system, but only a modification of the
views of the old Academy<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. Such a conclusion seems partly due
to the fact that the Stoics of his own time had largely borrowed
from the Academic system in detail; and partly to the overlooking
by Antiochus of an essential difference of spirit between the
two schools. Plato is speculative, Zeno positive; Plato plays with
a dozen theories, Zeno consistently adheres to one. Plato ranks
the mind high, Zeno the will; Plato bases his system on the
general concept, Zeno on the individual person or object. It
would seem that no contrast could be more complete. Nor
does Zeno’s theory agree with that of Epicurus. Both indeed
are positive teachers, and hold that the senses are messengers
of truth. But here Epicurus stops, whilst Zeno goes on. We
have to understand rightly the functions and limitations of the
senses, or we shall quickly glide into error; we have also to
learn that the senses are but servants, and that the mind rules
them as a monarch by divine right, coordinating the messages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
they bring, shaping them according to its own creative capacity,
even adding to them from the material it has derived from its
source. The Stoic theory is in fact a bold survey of the results
of the reflection of the human mind upon its own operations;
it has, as we might expect, many gaps, a good deal of overlapping
description, and some inconsistencies. To sceptical
objections it is of course unable to give answers which are
logically satisfactory; but its general position proved acceptable
to men who sought in philosophy a guide to practical life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Questions of temperament.</div>

<p id="section170"><b>170.</b> In the approximation between Stoicism and the
Academy which characterizes the first century
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the Stoic logic obtained in the end the upper
hand; and the logic of the so-called ‘old Academy’ founded by
Antiochus is in all essentials that of the Stoics. Nevertheless
the objections urged against it by Cicero represent not only
his reason but also his sentiments. The positive system appears
at its best in the education of children; and even at the present
day the theory of knowledge which is tacitly adopted in schools
is substantially that of the Stoics. It leads to careful observation,
earnest inquiry, and resolute choice; and thus lays the
foundation of solidity of character. But it must be admitted
that it also works in the direction of a certain roughness and
harshness of disposition. Not only is the Stoically-minded
man lacking in sympathy for beliefs different from his own,
which he is bound to regard as both foolish and wicked; but
he is also blind to that whole side of the universe which cannot
be reduced to syllogistic shape. Thus we may account for the
indifference or hostility with which most Stoics regarded both
literature and art<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. The Academic, on the other hand, even
if he lacked moral firmness and saw too clearly both sides of
every question, was saved by his critical powers from extreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
assertions and harsh personal judgments, and had a delicate
appreciation of the finer shadings of life. Thus behind the
formal differences of the two schools there lies a difference of
character. We have long since learnt that the fundamental
questions between the two schools are incapable of solution
by the human mind, and we can therefore appreciate the one
without condemning the other. In practical life each theory
has its appropriate sphere; but the Romans were hardly in
the wrong when in matters of doubt they leaned towards the
Stoic side.</p>

τοῦτο μίαν ἑκάστην τῶν ἐννοιῶν ἐναπογράφεται Aët. <i>plac.</i> iv 11, 1. The metaphor
of the <i>tabula rasa</i> can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle, but in this application
was first used by Cleanthes. Locke presumably borrowed it from the Stoics. It
must not be thought that this metaphor implies passivity on the part of the soul;
as the Stoics use it, the soul is from the beginning actively cooperating in obtaining
impressions. See Stein, <i>Psych.</i> ii pp. 112 sqq., note 230.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS.</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Physics.</div>

<p id="section171"><b>171.</b> Under the general heading of Physics the ancients
included a number of subjects which in modern
times form independent branches of philosophy.
Cleanthes subdivided the subject into Physics proper and
Theology<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Here it will be convenient to make a larger
number of subdivisions, so as to treat separately of (i) the
Foundations of Physics, generally called (after Aristotle’s
treatise) ‘Metaphysics’; (ii) Physics proper, that is, the account
of the Universe and its history; (iii) the final problems involved
in the history of the Universe, such as its government by Divine
Providence, the Existence of Evil, Free-will, and Chance;
(iv) the problems of Religion, such as the existence of gods,
their number, character, and claims on mankind; and (v) the
nature of Man, including the modern subjects of Psychology
and Physiology, and to some extent of Anthropology also,
treated by the Stoics as a Kingdom governed by the Soul.
According to Stoic principles these subjects cannot be separated
one from the other, or from the other parts of philosophy; and
therefore in treating each one we shall, as before, assume a
general knowledge of all the others. The Stoics laid great
stress upon the study of Physics, as the only sound basis for
a scientific rule of human conduct; and some of them (beginning
with Chrysippus), having especial regard to the elevated dignity
of the study of Theology, were disposed to rank this branch of
philosophy as the highest and last of its three principal divisions<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.
We shall however, in accordance with a view more generally
held, reserve the last place for Ethics<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fundamental Conceptions.</div>

<p id="section172"><b>172.</b> To the earlier Greek philosophers, as we have already
seen, it appeared that a single bold intuition was
enough, or almost enough, to discover a sufficient
foundation upon which to construct a reasoned account of all
things. Thus the Ionic philosophers took up as such a foundation
one or more of the elements of air, fire, and water. But
as soon as these three, together with earth, were recognized as
‘elements’ existing side by side, it became necessary to dig
deeper, so as to secure a foundation for these as well. Thus
Democritus resolved all four into ‘atoms’ and ‘void’; his theory
was taken over by Epicurus, and remains to this day not only
the most popular solution of the problem, but also that which
(till quite recently) was tacitly assumed as the basis of all
scientific investigation. Anaxagoras, working on different lines,
began his account of the universe with ‘mind’ on the one hand
and a primal conglomerate ‘matter’ on the other; a doctrine
evidently based upon the popular dualism of soul and body,
and still the basis of all transcendental philosophy and established
religious conceptions. This Aristotle varied by assuming rather
an ‘active’ and a ‘passive’ principle, force which works and
matter upon which it works. Besides these conceptions many
others need to be considered, which if not absolutely fundamental,
are nevertheless matters of discussion in all philosophical
schools, as those of motion, space, time, soul, body, God, the
universe, cause, effect, will and necessity. In this way the
original inquiry into the foundation of the universe developes
into a general study of fundamental conceptions; and it is at
this stage that it is taken over and dealt with by Stoicism,
which adds to the list certain conceptions on which it lays
a special stress and to which it gives a characteristic colour;
such are those of ‘body,’ ‘spirit,’ and ‘tone.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoic monism.</div>

<p id="section173"><b>173.</b> The fact that the Stoics use from time to time the
language of other schools or of popular speculation
does not necessarily imply that this language is
an adequate statement of their doctrine; and we frequently<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
find that the discussion of particular problems seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
based on dualisms, though these are in the end subordinated
to monistic statements. Thus in logic we have already noticed
the sharp contrast between the perceiving mind and the external
object of perception (αἰσθητόν, ὑπάρχον); nevertheless mind and
object are ultimately declared to be akin<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. So in particular the
popular dualism of ‘soul’ and ‘body’ is often accepted by the
Stoics, and yet as steadily superseded by the paradox that ‘soul
is body.’ The reason given for this is that ‘body is that which
acts and is acted upon<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>’; and this statement in the end overrides
the Aristotelian distinction of force and matter, active
principle and passive principle. ‘Body,’ as conceived by the
Stoics, is the one ultimate element, the foundation and beginning
of the universe; it contains within itself the capacity of action,
and nothing but ‘body’ has this capacity. Body, and nothing
but body, exists in the true sense; that certain other things have
a quasi-existence (as we shall see later in this chapter) is an
embarrassment which only brings into clearer relief this distinctive
feature of the system. The Stoic ‘body,’ though it
is also called ‘matter’ (ὕλη, <i>materia</i>), must not be confused
with the ‘matter’ of modern philosophy, which has derived
from Aristotle the implication of passivity<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; much more closely
it corresponds with the ‘stuff’ by which modern monistic philosophers
denote the substratum of mind and body alike. To call
the Stoics ‘materialists’ will generally prove misleading; it is
the Epicurean system, to which the Stoics were sharply opposed,
which (as we have seen)<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> corresponds to modern materialism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of ‘body.’</div>

<p id="section174"><b>174.</b> The conception of ‘body’ therefore replaces in the
Stoic system the various elements which the Ionic
philosophers assumed as the basis of the universe,
and combines both parts of such dualistic elements as were
assumed by Democritus, Anaxagoras and Aristotle. Since it
is the foundation of all things it must be capable of taking very
various shapes. In logic we have met with it under the name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
of the ‘substratum’ (τὸ ὑπάρχον, <i>id quod est</i>)<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, but it none the
less includes the ‘subject’ or feeling and reasoning mind. In
the universe as a whole it is ‘essence’ (οὐσία, <i>essentia</i>); in its
parts it is ‘matter’ (ὕλη, <i>silva</i>)<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; but it also appears, possessed
of intelligence, as the deity<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, and again is identified with ‘breath’
or ‘spirit<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,’ and through this with the human soul<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Even in
ethics it has its place; for all causes are bodily, and not least
‘the good’ and the respective virtues, all of which are bodies,
for they act upon body<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; similarly the emotions such as anger
and melancholy, are of the nature of body<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motion, space and time.</div>

<p id="section175"><b>175.</b> The Stoic ‘body’ in all its transformations is active
and alert. It contains in itself the principle or
power of movement; for though we observe that
one body is set in motion by another, yet this could not be the
case unless in the beginning there had been a body which had
movement of itself<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. As to the nature of the primal movement,
the Stoics agree with Anaximenes that it may be described as
alternate rarefaction and condensation. Rarefaction is a wave
or ‘spirit’ spreading from the centre to the extremities; condensation
is a contrary movement from the extremities to the
centre<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. The extension of body is ‘space,’ which therefore does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
not exist of itself, but only as a function of body<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. Where there
is no body (and body is limited), there is no space, but only the
‘boundless void’ beyond the universe<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; of this we cannot say
that it ‘exists’; rather it ‘not exists.’ Time also does not exist
of itself, but only in the movement of body<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. Neither space
nor time existed before the universe, but have been all along
bound up with it<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Body comprises life and thought.</div>

<p id="section176"><b>176.</b> In almost every particular we find a sharp contrast
between the Stoic conception of ‘body’ and the
Epicurean ‘atom.’ The atom is extremely small
and entirely unchangeable; ‘body’ is immensely
large and in a high degree plastic. Atoms alternate with void;
but ‘body’ spreads continuously throughout the entire universe;
it can never be torn apart or show a gap<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Atoms move downwards
in parallel straight lines; ‘body’ moves from the centre to
the circumference, and thence returns to the centre. Two atoms
can never occupy the same space; but ‘body’ everywhere moves
through body, penetrating it and combining with it throughout
its whole extent<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. The atom is a convenient hypothesis within
the range of modern physical and chemical science; the conception
of ‘body’ gains force as we enter the region of biology.
For life also is a movement which proceeds from a warm centre
(and warmth is body rarefied), and extends towards a circumference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
which is in comparison gross and cold<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. Going
further, we find that ‘body’ and its functions are so interpreted
as to provide a key to the activities of the human reason
and will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tone or tension.</div>

<p id="section177"><b>177.</b> To the central conception of body are attached in the
Stoic system various supplementary conceptions,
which serve to bring into clearer view its nature
and powers. Of these the most characteristic is that of ‘tone’
or ‘strain’ (τόνος, <i>intentio</i>). This term appears originally to
have expressed muscular activity<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, and was next used by the
Cynics to denote that active condition of the soul which is the
true end of life; ‘no labour,’ said Diogenes, ‘is noble, unless its
end is tone of soul<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.’ Although we cannot trace the term ‘tone’
directly to Zeno, we find that he explains sleep as a relaxation
of the soul, substantially agreeing with later writers who call it
a ‘relaxation of the sensory tone around the soul<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.’ With
Cleanthes the word becomes fairly common, first in the ethical
application, in which ‘tone’ is ‘a shock of fire, which if it be
strong enough to stir the soul to fulfil its duties is called strength
and force<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>,’ and then in physics to explain the unceasing activity
of the universe<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, personified by Hercules in Stoic allegorical
theology<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. In later writers tone becomes constantly associated
with the ‘spirit’ or ‘thrill’ which explains both the unity and the
movement of all things<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, so that ‘tone of spirit’ or ‘thrill-tone’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
(πνευματικὸς τόνος, <i>intentio spiritus</i>) explains to us the operations
of body and mind alike<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The seed power.</div>

<p id="section178"><b>178.</b> Body however is not only active but creative; there is
inherent in it a power, which is that of the ‘seed’
(σπέρμα, <i>semen</i>), and which is most conspicuously
illustrated in the seed of animals and plants. It is the characteristic
of seed that from a small beginning it developes a great
plan, and that this plan never changes<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. This plan or purpose
is named by the Stoics its ‘reason’ or ‘word’ (λόγος), and at
this point Stoicism incorporates the doctrine of the ‘Word’
or universal reason with which it became acquainted through
Heraclitus. The ‘Word’ or ‘seed-power’ (λόγος σπερματικός)
of the universe is one; it is the primal fire in its work of creation;
it is Zeus the Creator who moulds gross matter into the things
that are to be<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>; it is wisdom which plies matter as it will<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. But
there are also in individual objects, animate and inanimate, indestructible
seed-powers, countless in number, displayed alike
in growth, procreation, and purpose<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; these seed-powers are,
as it were, spirits or deities, spread throughout the universe,
everywhere shaping, peopling, designing, multiplying; they are
activities of fiery spirit working through tension<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in its highest
development. But the seed-power of the universe comprehends
in itself all the individual seed-powers; they are begotten of it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
and shall in the end return to it. Thus in the whole work of
creation and re-absorption<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> we see the work of one Zeus, one
divine Word, one all-pervading spirit<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cause.</div>

<p id="section179"><b>179.</b> Closely akin to the theory of ‘seed-powers’ and the
Word is that of ‘cause’ (αἰτία, <i>causa</i>). Aristotle
had already explained this term in connexion with
cosmogony, laying down that, in order that a universe may come
into being, three ‘causes’ are required; matter, without which
nothing can be made; a workman, to make things; and the form
or shape, which is imposed on every work as on a statue. To
these may be added a fourth cause, the purpose of the work.
Thus to produce a statue we need the bronze, the artist, the
design, and the fee. Grammatically these causes may be
expressed by the help of prepositions, as the <i>ex quo</i>, <i>a quo</i>,
<i>in quo</i> and <i>propter quod</i><a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. To this theory of multiple causes
the Stoics oppose the doctrine of a single ‘first cause,’ the maker
of the universe. This first cause can be none other than the
primal creative fire in a new aspect; equally it is the creative
Word.</p>

<p>It seems well to translate here in full the argument of Seneca
on this point, for it stands almost alone as an example of his
powers in continuous exposition:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Stoic dogma is that there is one cause only, the maker. Aristotle
holds that cause is threefold. ‘The first cause,’ he says, ‘is the material
itself, for without it nothing can be made. The second cause is the maker.
The third is the design, which is impressed on every single work as on a
statue;’ this Aristotle calls the εἶδος. I will now explain what he means.</p>

<p>The bronze is the first cause of a statue; for it could never have been
made, had there not been stuff to be cast or wrought into shape. The
second cause is the sculptor; for the bronze could never have been brought
into the shape of a statue without the artist’s touch. The third cause is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
design; for the statue would not be called the ‘javelin-man’ or the ‘crowned
king’ had not such a design been impressed upon it.</p>

<p>There is besides a fourth cause, the purpose. What is purpose? It is
that which induced the sculptor to undertake the work, the aim that he had
in view. It may have been money, if he intended to sell it; or glory, if he
wished to make himself a name; or religious feeling, if he proposed to
present it to a temple. That for the sake of which a thing is done is therefore
also a cause; for you cannot think it right in making up a list of causes
to omit something, apart from which the thing would never have been made.</p>

<p>Thus Aristotle postulates a multiplicity of causes; but we maintain that
the list is either too long or too short.</p>

<p>If we hold that everything, apart from which the thing would never have
been made, is a cause of its making, then the list is too short. We ought to
reckon time as a cause, for nothing can be made without time. We ought
to reckon space as a cause; for if there is no room for a thing to be made,
it will certainly not be made. Movement too should be placed in the list;
for without movement nothing can be produced or destroyed; without
movement there can be neither art nor change.</p>

<p>We Stoics look for a first and general cause. Such a cause must be
single, for the stuff of the universe is single. We ask what that cause is,
and reply that it is the creative reason, the deity. The various causes in
the list that has been made are not a series of independent causes, but are
all variations of a single cause, namely ‘the maker<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Causation and free-will.</div>

<p id="section180"><b>180.</b> Although the ‘first cause’ and the ‘Word’ are thus
formally identified, their associations in connexion
with cosmogony are very different. For whereas
the ‘Word’ suggests reason and purpose, and leads up to the
dogma that the universe is governed by divine providence, the
term ‘cause’ suggests the linking of cause and effect by an
unending chain, the inevitable sequence of events which leaves
no room for effort or hope. These terms therefore point to the
supreme problems of Fate and divine Purpose, Determinism and
Free-will, and as such will be discussed in a later chapter<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.
Here it is sufficient to note that the Stoics not only accept,
but insist upon the use of terms suggesting both points of view,
and look therefore beyond their immediate opposition to an
ultimate reconciliation; and that the importance attached to
the doctrine of a ‘single and general cause’ by no means
excludes a multiplicity of individual causes depending upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
it, and capable of classification according to their relative importance<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The categories.</div>

<p id="section181"><b>181.</b> Thus the conception of ‘body,’ so simple to the plain
man, becomes to the philosopher manifold and
intricate. Its interpretation is to some extent
brought into harmony with common speech through the doctrine
of the ‘categories’ based upon Aristotle’s teaching<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. But
whereas Aristotle endeavoured in his categories to classify the
various but independent classes of existences, the Stoics considered
the different aspects in which the one primary body might
be studied. The first two categories, those of ‘substance’ (ὑποκείμενον)
and of ‘quality’ (ποιόν), agree with those of Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>,
and clearly correspond to the grammatical categories of noun
and adjective. The third category is that of ‘disposition’ (πὼς
ἔχον), as ‘lying down’ or ‘standing<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.’ The fourth is that of
‘relative position’ (πρός τί πως ἔχον), as ‘right’ and ‘left,’ ‘son’
and ‘father<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.’ Some of the categories are further subdivided<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>;
but enough is here stated to shew the object of the analysis,
which in practice may have been useful in securing some
completeness in the discussion of particular conceptions. Of
‘substances’ the Stoics, like others, say that they ‘exist,’ and
are ‘bodies’; of qualities they boldly say the same<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. But
they do not consistently apply the same terms to disposition
and relative position; in this direction they are at last led,
like other philosophers, to speak of things which ‘do not exist.’
They could not take the modern view that all such discussions
are verbal entanglements, of which no solution is possible, because
they believed that there was a natural harmony between
words and things. We on the other hand shall be little inclined
to follow their analysis into its manifold details<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Substance.</div>

<p id="section182"><b>182.</b> The analysis of the first two categories, those of
Substance and Quality, leads us at once to the
profoundest problems of Metaphysics; and even
if we allow that the difficulty is primarily grammatical, and
resolves itself into a discussion of the functions of Substantive
and Adjective, it is none the less inextricably interwoven with
all our habits of thought. It would be unreasonable to expect
from the Stoics perfectly clear and consistent language on this
point; they absorb into their system much from popular philosophy,
and much from the teaching of Aristotle in particular.
The view which is distinctively Stoic is that Substance and
Quality are both body<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, but in two different aspects. The
terms ‘body’ and ‘substance’ refer to the same reality, but
do not describe it with the same fulness. Yet because the
very word ‘substance’ (οὐσία) suggests existence, the Stoics
are drawn also to speak of ‘substance without quality’ (ἄποιος
οὐσία), and seem to identify it with a dead ‘matter’ (ὕλη), or
‘substratum’ (ὑποκείμενον), as though life must be introduced
into it from without<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. This is practically the view of Aristotle,
embodied in the phrase ‘matter without quality is potentially
body’<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; but just so far as terms of this kind imply a dualistic
explanation of the universe, they are not really reconcileable
with the fundamental principles of Stoicism, and they must
therefore be understood with reservations. It may often seem
that the three terms ‘body,’ ‘substance,’ ‘matter,’ are practically
interchangeable, but they are of different rank. For body exists
eternally of itself; whereas substance and matter, except when
loosely used as equivalents of body, do not exist of themselves,
but substance always in association with quality<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, and matter
always in association with force. Further we may distinguish
between ‘substance’ in general, or ‘first matter,’ which is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
‘substratum’ (ὑποκείμενον) to the universe, and the ‘matter’ of
particular things<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. The former never grows greater or less,
the latter may alter in either direction<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quality.</div>

<p id="section183"><b>183.</b> Quality (ποιότης, τὸ ποιόν, <i>qualitas</i>) constitutes the
second category. It is defined by the Stoics as a
difference in a substance which cannot be detached
from that substance, but makes it ‘such and such,’ as for instance
‘sweet,’ ‘round,’ ‘red,’ ‘hot<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.’ Qualities, say the Stoics, are
bodies<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. This paradoxical statement may be understood in
two ways; first, in that qualities do not exist independently,
but are aspects of ‘body’ which possesses quality; secondly,
in that qualities are bodies in a secondary sense. We may
consider it evidence of the second point of view that language
describes the qualities by nouns, as ‘sweetness,’ ‘rotundity,’
‘redness,’ ‘heat’; and indeed it is not so long since our own
chemists described heat as a ‘substance’ under the name of
‘caloric.’ This point of view is carried to an extreme when
the Stoics say ‘qualities are substances,’ thus throwing the
first two categories into one<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. Much stronger is the tendency
towards Aristotle’s views, so that as substance becomes identified
with dead matter, quality is explained as the movement,
tension, or current which endows it with life. Hence the Stoics
say ‘the movement of rarefaction is the cause of quality<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>’;
‘matter is a dull substratum, qualities are spirits and air-like
tensions<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>’; ‘quality is a spirit in a certain disposition<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>’; ‘the
air-current which keeps each thing together is the cause of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
quality<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.’ All these expressions must however be interpreted
in the light of the Stoic theory as a whole. Finally we notice
that, corresponding to the two kinds of substance, general and
particular, there are two kinds of quality, as shewn in the
‘generically qualified’ (κοινῶς ποιόν) and the ‘individually
qualified’ (ἰδίως ποιόν); for instance, heat in the universe and
heat in particular objects<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disposition.</div>

<p id="section184"><b>184.</b> The third category is that of ‘disposition’ (πὼς
ἔχοντα, <i>res quodammodo se habens</i>). It differs
from quality in its variableness; for a brave man
is always brave, and fire is always hot; but a man is sometimes
standing, sometimes lying; fire is sometimes lambent,
sometimes still. Qualities therefore appear to correspond
generally to the συμβεβηκότα (<i>coniuncta</i>) of Epicurus, in that
they can never be separated from a body<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; and dispositions
rather with the συμπτώματα (<i>eventa</i>), which come and go<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.
The third category appears to be used by the Stoics in a very
wide sense, and to correspond to several of the categories of
Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Disposition is attached to quality as quality is
attached to substance<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; and though dispositions are not expressly
termed bodies, yet we must consider them to be, as
the terms in the Greek and Latin sufficiently indicate, bodies
in particular aspects.</p>

<p>In the further applications of Stoic theory disposition as
defined above appears to be replaced in Greek by the term
ἕξις. But this term is used in two different senses. In the
first place it is the movement of rarefaction and condensation,
by which a spirit or thrill passes from the centre of an object
to the extremities, and returns from the extremities to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
centre<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>; in this sense it is translated in Latin by <i>unitas</i>,
and takes bodily form as an air-current<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. This force, when
it requires a further motive power in the direction of development,
becomes the principle of growth (φύσις, <i>natura</i>),
and is displayed not only in the vegetable world, but also in
animals, as in particular in the hair and nails<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Growth when
it takes to itself the further powers of sensation and impulse
becomes soul (ψυχή, <i>anima</i>), and is the distinctive mark of
the animal world<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<p>In a rather different sense ἕξις or temporary condition is
contrasted with διάθεσις or ‘permanent disposition.’ In this
sense the virtues are permanent dispositions of the soul, because
virtue is unchanging; the arts are temporary conditions. The
virtues belong to the wise man only, the arts to the ordinary
man. This distinction however does not hold its ground in
the Roman period, the word <i>habitus</i> (representing ἕξις), our
‘habit,’ being used in both senses<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. The virtues are bodies,
being dispositions of the soul which is bodily<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relative position.</div>

<p id="section185"><b>185.</b> The fourth category, that of ‘relative position’ (πρός
τί πως ἔχον) appears to be of less importance
than the others<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Its characteristic is that it
may disappear without altering that to which it belongs. Thus
that which is on the right hand may cease to be so by the disappearance
of that which was on its left; a father may cease to
be such on the death of his son<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. It seems difficult to describe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
the fourth category as one consisting of ‘body,’ but at least it is
a function of body. Also it does not appear that ‘relative position’
can be predicated of the universe as a whole; it is peculiar
to individual objects, but works towards their combination in a
larger whole. The fourth category has an important application
in practical ethics in the doctrine of daily duties, for these are
largely determined by the relative positions (σχέσεις) of the
parties concerned: such are the duties of a king to his people,
a father to his son, a slave to his master<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Combination.</div>

<p id="section186"><b>186.</b> Having fully considered bodies and their relationships,
we proceed to consider their combination. In
ordinary experience we meet with three kinds of
combination; juxtaposition (παράθεσις), as in a mixture of
various kinds of grain; mixture (μῖξις), when solid bodies are
interfused, as fire and heat, or fusion (κρᾶσις), when fluids are
interfused, as wine poured into the sea; chemical mixture
(σύγχυσις), when each of the two bodies fused disappears<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. Of
these the second in its most completed form (κρᾶσις δι’ ὅλων,
<i>universa fusio</i>) is of high importance. For in this way we find
that soul is fused with body<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, quality with substance<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, light with
air<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, God with the universe<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. Aristotle admits that there is this
mixture between substance and qualities; but as both of these
are to the Stoics bodies, and so too are the members of the other
pairs quoted, the Stoic doctrine must be summed up in the
paradox ‘body moves through body<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.’ This also follows from
the Stoic doctrine that there is no void in the universe. Correspondingly
the sum total of body in its various aspects and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
mixtures completes the whole (ὅλον), which is identical with
the ‘world-order’ or ‘universe’ (κόσμος)<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. It seems likely that
this important conception had been reached in very early times
by the Chaldaean astronomers; it was definitely propounded
by Pythagoras<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, had been taken up by Socrates<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and the
Sophists<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, and was in Stoic times generally accepted both in
popular philosophy and in scientific investigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quiddities.</div>

<p id="section187"><b>187.</b> Up to this point the Stoic system has been guided
by a determined monism. Body is; that which is
not body is not. Yet in the end the Stoics feel
compelled to speak of certain things which are not body
(ἀσώματα, <i>incorporalia</i>). In the first instance there is the void
beyond the universe<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. It is possible to dispute as to whether
void may more correctly be said to exist or not to exist; but
at least it is a part of nature<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, and we need some term like
‘the all’ (τὸ πᾶν) to include both the universe and the void
beyond<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Next we have to deal with statements (λεκτά), and
mental conceptions of every kind, which stand as a class in
contrast with the real objects to which they may or may not
respectively correspond<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. Lastly, the Stoics included space
and time, which they had previously explained as functions of
body, in the list of things not bodily<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. Having thus reached
the two main classes of ‘bodies,’ and ‘things not bodily,’ the
monistic principle can only be saved by creating a supreme
class to include both. Let this then be called the existent
(τὸ ὄν, <i>quod est</i>)<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, or, if it be objected that things incorporeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
do not exist<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, we may use the name ‘quiddities’ (τινά, <i>quid</i>)<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.
In this way the monistic theory, though a little damaged in
vitality, is again set on its feet so far as the ingenious use
of words can help.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Statements.</div>

<p id="section188"><b>188.</b> The language of the Stoics with regard to the phenomena
of speech and thought is not always easy to
follow, and perhaps not altogether consistent. On
the one hand, attaching high importance to the reasoning power,
they desire to include its operations in that which is real and
bodily. Thus the ‘mind-pictures’ and indeed all mental conceptions
are bodily and even ‘animal,’ in the sense that they are
operations of body<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>; and truthfulness, ignorance, science and art
are all bodies in the sense that they are dispositions of the soul,
which is bodily<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. But ‘phrases’ (λεκτά) are definitely incorporeal,
and with them appear to be ranked all mental conceptions
and general ideas; about these there is a question, not merely
whether they exist or not, but whether they may even be classed
in the most general class of all as ‘quiddities<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.’ Nor can we call
general conceptions true or false<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; though of some of them, as
of Centaurs, giants, and the like, we may say that they are formed
by false mental processes<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Finally statements are either true
or false, but are not to be called existent. The whole discussion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
therefore ends with the broad distinction between the object,
which may be real or ‘existent,’ and the predication which may
be ‘true’; and the attempt to unite these two conceptions is not
persisted in<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Force and matter.</div>

<p id="section189"><b>189.</b> Although the Stoics aim consistently at the monistic
standard, they make frequent use of dualistic statements,
some of which we have already noticed.
The Latin writers often contrast soul and body from the standpoint
of ethics<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>; and we meet in all the Stoic writers, and often
in unguarded language, the favourite Aristotelian dualism of force
and matter, or (what comes to the same thing) the active and
passive principles. ‘Zeno’ (we are told) ‘laid down that there
are two principles in the universe, the active and the passive.
The passive is matter, or essence without quality; the active is
the Logos or deity within it<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.’ So also Cleanthes and Chrysippus
taught<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>; and in the Roman period Seneca regarded this as a
well-understood dogma of the whole school<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. But even if direct
evidence were lacking, the whole bearing of the philosophy would
shew that this dualism is also surmounted by an ultimate monism.
God and matter are alike body; they cannot exist the one apart
from the other<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. Of this Cicero, speaking for the Stoics, gives
a proof; matter could never have held together, without some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
force to bind it; nor force without matter<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. We must not
therefore be led by the term ‘principles’ (ἀρχαί, <i>principia</i>) to
think of force and matter in any other way than as two aspects
of primary body, separable as mental conceptions, inseparable
as physical realities. The interpretation is essentially the same,
whether the Stoics speak of God and the universe, matter and
cause, body and tension, or substance and quality, and has
been already discussed with some fulness under these separate
headings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The elements.</div>

<p id="section190"><b>190.</b> The position of the four ‘elements’ (στοιχεῖα, <i>elementa</i>)
is similar; these are in the Stoic philosophy subdivisions
of the two principles just discussed. For
fire and air are of the nature of cause and movement; water and
earth of receptivity and passivity<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. Body is therefore made up
of the four elements mixed<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, or perhaps rather of the elementary
qualities of heat and cold, dry and wet, which they represent<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.
The doctrine of primary or elemental qualities had been taught
before, first by Anaximenes, then by Hippocrates the physician,
and by Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; the list of the four elements is traced back
to Empedocles. For Aristotle’s ‘fifth element’ Zeno found no
use<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion.</div>

<p id="section191"><b>191.</b> Such are the fundamental conceptions or postulates
with which the Stoics approach the problems of
physics. It is not necessary for our purpose to
compare their merit with those of Aristotle, or to set a value
on the debt that Zeno and his successors owed to the founder
of the Peripatetic school. Still less do we suggest that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Stoics have perfectly analyzed the contents of the universe, or
have even produced an orderly and rounded scheme. But at
least it seems clear that their work shews intellectual power,
and that speculation is not necessarily less profound because
it is pursued with a practical aim<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. The founders of the
Stoic philosophy had a wide reach; they took all knowledge
to be their province; and they worked persistently towards
the harmonization of all its parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Study of the heavens.</div>

<p id="section192"><b>192.</b> In including in their system the study of the physical
universe the Stoics broke daringly with Socrates
and his faithful followers the Cynics. These had
joined with the ignorant and the prejudiced<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in ridiculing those
whose eyes were always turned up towards the sky, whilst they
saw nothing of things that were nearer at hand and concerned
them more closely. But it was not for nothing that the most
highly civilised nations of antiquity, Egyptians, Chaldaeans, and
Babylonians, had studied the starry heavens, mapped out the
constellations, measured the paths of the wandering stars, predicted
eclipses, reckoned with the tides, the seasons, and the
winds; with the result that their successors defied the common
opinion by declaring the earth to be a sphere, and to hold
inhabitants whom they called Antipodes, because they walk
with their feet turned up towards ours<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. All this body of
knowledge, called generically the knowledge of the sky (though
it included the whole physical geography of the earth), had
impressed and fascinated the Eastern world. It seemed that
as the eyes were raised to the sky, so the mind of man was
elevated and made ampler and nobler<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, leaving behind it the
petty contentions and rivalries of common life; and further
that true knowledge had surely been reached, when the positions
of the heavenly bodies and the eclipses of sun and moon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
could be predicted so long before with unfailing accuracy.
These feelings are now commonplaces of literature, and were
fully shared by the Stoics. ‘Is not the sun,’ says Seneca,
‘worthy of our gaze, the moon of our regard? When the sky
displays its fires at night, and countless stars flash forth, who
is not absorbed in contemplation of them? They glide past
in their company, concealing swift motion under the outward
appearance of immobility. We comprehend the movements of
a few of them, but the greater number are beyond our ken.
Their dignity fills all our thoughts<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.’ In the golden age which
preceded our iron civilisation ‘men lay at nights in the open
fields, and watched the glorious spectacle of the heavens. It
was their delight to note the stars that sank in one quarter
and rose in another. The universe swept round them, performing
its magnificent task in silence<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.’ ‘Their order never
changes, spring and autumn, winter and summer succeed
according to fixed laws<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.’ And in the same tone writes the
Stoic poet: ‘unshaken the lights of heaven ever move onwards
in their proper orbit<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.’ The emotion roused in the Stoic by
the contemplation of the sky was thus identical with that
expressed in Judaic poetry by the ‘Song of the Three Holy
Children<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,’ and in more modern times by Addison’s famous
hymn<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The world-order.</div>

<p id="section193"><b>193.</b> The phenomena of earth and heaven combined, in
the general opinion of intelligent men, to show
the existence of a ‘world-order’ or ‘universe<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.’
The Stoics accepted this conception in their physics from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
Heraclitus, who had declared that ‘neither god nor man created
this world-order,’ as in their ethics from Diogenes, the ‘citizen
of the universe<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.’ They therefore needed only to adjust an
established notion to their own physical postulates. We observe
at once that the very conception of an ordered whole differentiates
that whole from the absolute totality of all things. The
universe is indeed on the one hand identified with the substance
of all things (οὐσία τῶν ὅλων), but only as a thing made individual
by the possession of quality (ἰδίως ποιόν)<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, and necessarily
one<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. It is self-created; and it may therefore be identified with
its creator, the deity<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; it also includes all that is bodily<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; but
outside there remains the boundless void<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. It is therefore
defined by Chrysippus as ‘the combination of heaven and
earth and all natures that are in them,’ or alternatively as ‘the
combination of gods and men and all that is created for their
sake<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its position.</div>

<p id="section194"><b>194.</b> The Stoic conception of the universe is therefore that
of a continuous body, having a definite outline, and
stationed in the boundless void. That the universe
has shape the Stoics deduce from its having ‘nature’ (φύσις),
that is, the principle of growth, displayed in the symmetry of its
parts<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; and its shape is the perfect shape of a sphere<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Within
this sphere all things tend towards the middle<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; and we use the
terms ‘down’ meaning ‘towards the middle,’ and ‘up’ meaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
thereby from the middle<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. The Peripatetics are therefore needlessly
alarmed, when they tell us that our universe will fall down,
if it stands in the void; for, first, there is no ‘up’ or ‘down’ outside
the universe; and, secondly, the universe possesses ‘unity’
(ἕξις)<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which keeps it together<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. And here we see the folly of
Epicurus, who says that the atoms move downwards from
eternity in the boundless void; for there is no such thing as
‘downwards’ in that which is unlimited<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. Further, the universe
is divided into two parts, the earth (with the water and the air
surrounding it) which is stable in the middle, and the sky or
aether which revolves around it<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The heliocentric theory.</div>

<p id="section195"><b>195.</b> Thus early in their theory the Stoics were led to
make two assertions on questions of scientific fact,
in which they opposed the best scientific opinion
of their own time. For many authorities held that the earth
revolved on its axis, and that the revolution of the sky was
only apparent. Such were <span class="smcap">Hicetas</span> of Syracuse<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, a Pythagorean
philosopher, whose views were quoted with approval by
Theophrastus, and later <span class="smcap">Ecphantus</span> the Pythagorean, and
<span class="smcap">Heraclides</span> of Pontus<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. From the point of view of astronomical
science this view seemed well worthy of consideration, as
Seneca in particular emphasizes<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. Other astronomers had gone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
further, declaring that the sun lay in the centre, and that the
earth and other planets revolved round it. Theophrastus stated
that Plato himself in his old age had felt regret that he had
wrongly placed the earth in the centre of the universe; and the
heliocentric view was put forward tentatively by <span class="smcap">Aristarchus</span>
of Samos, and positively by the astronomer <span class="smcap">Seleucus</span>, in
connexion with the theory of the earth’s rotation<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. For this
Cleanthes had said that the Greeks should have put Aristarchus
on trial for impiety, as one who proposed to disturb ‘the hearth
of the universe<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.’ This outburst of persecuting zeal, anticipating
so remarkably the persecution of Galileo, was effective in preventing
the spread of the novel doctrine. Posidonius was a great
astronomer, and recognised the heliocentric doctrine as theoretically
possible<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; indeed, as one who had himself constructed an
orrery, shewing the motion of all the planets<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, he must have
been aware of its superior simplicity. Nevertheless he opposed
it vigorously on theological grounds, and perhaps more than any
other man was responsible for its being pushed aside for some
1500 years<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. The precise ground of the objection is not made
very clear to us, and probably it was instinctive rather than
reasoned. It could hardly be deemed impious to place the sun,
whom the Stoics acknowledged as a deity, in the centre of the
universe; but that the earth should be reckoned merely as one
of his attendant planets was humiliating to human self-esteem,
and jeopardised the doctrine of Providence, in accordance with
which the universe was created for the happiness of gods and
men only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The elements.</div>

<p id="section196"><b>196.</b> Having determined that the earth is the centre of the
universe, and the sun above it, the way is clear to
incorporate in the system the doctrine of the four
elements (στοιχεῖα, <i>naturae</i>)<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, which probably had its origin in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
a cruder form of physical speculation than the doctrine of the
heavenly bodies. As we have seen above<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, the elements are
not first principles of the Stoic physics, but hold an intermediate
position between the two principles of the active and the passive
on the one hand, and the organic and inorganic world on the
other. Earth is the lowest of the elements, and also the
grossest; above it is placed water, then air, then fire; and
these are in constant interchange, earth turning to water, this
into air, and this into aether, and so again in return. By this
interchange the unity of the universe is maintained<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. The
transition from one element to the next is not abrupt, but
gradual; the lowest part of the aether is akin to air<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; it is
therefore of no great importance whether we speak with Heraclitus
of three elements, or with Empedocles of four. The two
grosser elements, earth and water, tend by nature downwards
and are passive; air and fire tend upwards and are active<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
Zeno did not think it necessary to postulate a fifth element as
the substance of soul, for he held that fire was its substance<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fire and breath.</div>

<p id="section197"><b>197.</b> Fire, heat, and motion are ultimately identical, and are
the source of all life<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. Thus the elemental and
primary fire stands in contrast with the fire of
domestic use; the one creates and nourishes, the other destroys<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
It follows that fire, though it is one of the four elements, has
from its divine nature a primacy amongst the elements<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, which
corresponds to its lofty position in the universe<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>; and the other
elements in turn all contain some proportion of fire. Thus
although air has cold and darkness as primary and essential
qualities<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, nevertheless it cannot exist without some share of
warmth<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. Hence air also may be associated with life, and it
is possible to retain the popular term ‘spirit’ (πνεῦμα, <i>spiritus</i>)
for the principle of life. In the development of the Stoic
philosophy we seldom hear again of air in connexion with
coldness; and between the ‘warm breath’ (<i>anima inflammata</i>)
and the primary fire there is hardly a distinction; we may even
say that ‘spirit’ has the highest possible tension<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God in the stone.</div>

<p id="section198"><b>198.</b> Air on its downward path changes to water. This
change is described as due to loss of heat<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, and
yet water too has some heat and vitality<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. Even
earth, the lowest and grossest of the elements, contains a share
of the divine heat; otherwise it could not feed living plants and
animals, much less send up exhalations with which to feed the
sun and stars<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Thus we may say even of a stone that it has
a part of the divinity in it<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. Here then we see the reverse side
of the so-called Stoic materialism. If it is true that God is body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
and that the soul is body, it is equally true that even water, the
damp and cold element, and earth, the dry and cold element,
are both penetrated by the divinity, by the creative fire without
the operation of which both would fall in an instant into nothingness<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The heavenly bodies.</div>

<p id="section199"><b>199.</b> We return to the consideration of the heavenly bodies.
These are set in spheres of various diameter, all
alike revolving around the earth. The succession
we find described in Plato’s <i>Timaeus</i><a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; the moon is nearest to
the earth, then comes the sun, then in order Venus, Mercury,
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. This theory was taken up by
Aristotle and after him by Eudoxus, from whom it passed to
Aratus and Chrysippus<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. A tradition derived from Chaldaean
sources gave a different order, setting Venus and Mercury
nearer to the earth than the sun; and this order was accepted
by the middle Stoics, that is to say by Panaetius and Posidonius,
the latter placing Venus nearer to the earth, and therefore
further from the sun, than Mercury<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. The moon, like the
earth, obtains her light from the sun, being crescent-shaped
when nearest to him, full-orbed when furthest away. Her
distance from the earth is two million stadia (250,000 miles);
when she lies between the earth and the sun she eclipses his
light, but when she is on the side of the earth directly away
from the sun she is herself eclipsed<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Her phases are explained
by her position relative to the sun<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. The sun is 60 millions of
miles from the earth<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; his diameter is 37½ times as large as that
of the earth<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>; he appears larger when on the horizon because
his rays are refracted through the thick atmosphere<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
planets, whether they revolve round the earth or the sun, are
falsely called ‘wandering stars,’ since their orbits have been
fixed from all eternity<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. The fixed stars revolve round the
earth at such a distance that the earth, when compared with
it, is merely the central point<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. All the heavenly bodies are,
like the earth, of spherical form<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. Finally Seneca, in advance
of the school, declared the comets to be a regular part of the
celestial world<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[62a]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cruder theories.</div>

<p id="section200"><b>200.</b> Whilst the Stoics generally were in sympathy with
the best astronomical teaching of their time, they
combined with it many views based on much
cruder forms of observation. Even Seneca thinks it bold to
suggest that the sun is not a little larger than the whole earth<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>;
and it is commonly held that not only the sun and moon, but
also the heavenly bodies generally, feed upon moist exhalations
from the Ocean<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Cleanthes in particular seems to have viewed
the astronomers with suspicion. He alone regarded the moon
not as a sphere, but as a hemisphere with the flat side turned
towards us<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; the stars he considered to be conical<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. These
views, very probably derived from Heraclitus, seem to point
to the conception of the sky or aether as a single fixed fiery
sphere, in which the heavenly bodies only differ from the surrounding
element by containing more closely packed masses of
fiery matter<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; a conception which harmonizes far more closely
with the Stoic theory of the elements than the doctrines which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
are astronomically more correct. Cleanthes also explained that
the sun could not venture to travel beyond his solstitial positions,
lest he should be out of reach of his terrestrial food<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. And
Cleanthes and Posidonius agree that the sun keeps within the
‘torrid zone’ of the sky, because beneath it flows the Ocean,
from which the sun sucks up his nutriment<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deity of the stars.</div>

<p id="section201"><b>201.</b> From the relation of the heavenly bodies to the
element of fire the Stoics draw the conclusion
that they are animated, reasoning, self-determined,
and divine; in short, that they are gods<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. This godhead pertains
particularly to the sun<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Of this doctrine Cleanthes is
especially the upholder<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, deeming that the sun is the ruling
power in the universe, as reason in man<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. It is not clear
whether the Stoics derived their theory of the divinity of the
heavenly bodies from logical deduction, or whether they were
here incorporating some Eastern worship. In favour of the
latter point of view is the consideration that at this time the
association of Mithra with the sun was probably making
some progress in the Persian religion, and that the popular
names of the seven days of the week, following the names
of the sun, moon, and five planets, must have been already
current.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deity of the universe.</div>

<p id="section202"><b>202.</b> But in the Stoic system this doctrine is overshadowed
by the paradox that the universe itself is a rational
animal, possessed of free-will and divine. This is
the teaching of all the masters of the school, beginning with
Zeno himself. It appeared to him to follow logically from two
principles, the first that the universe possesses a unity, the
second that the whole is greater than its parts. ‘There cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
be a sentient part of a non-sentient whole. But the parts of the
universe are sentient; therefore the universe is sentient<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.’ ‘The
rational is better than the non-rational. But nothing is better
than the universe; therefore the universe is rational<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.’ ‘The
universe is one<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>’; we must not therefore think of it as of an
army or a family, which comes into a kind of existence merely
through the juxtaposition of its members. By the same reasoning
the universe possesses divinity<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. Upon this favourite Stoic
text is based the frequent assertion of modern commentators
that the philosophy is pantheistic<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>; but the more central position
of Stoicism is that the deity bears the same relation to the
universe as a man’s soul to his body<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, and the universe is therefore
no more all divine than a man is all soul. This view is
expressed with great clearness by Varro, who says: ‘As a man
is called wise, being wise in mind, though he consists of mind
and body; so the world is called God from its soul, though it
consists of soul and body<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.’ The Stoics are however in strong
conflict with the Epicureans and all philosophers who hold that
the world is fundamentally all matter, and that soul and mind
are developments from matter. ‘Nothing that is without mind
can generate that which possesses mind,’ says Cicero’s Stoic<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
in full opposition to modern popular theories of evolution.
Further, just as it may be questioned in the case of man
whether the soul is situated in the head or in the heart, so in
the case of the universe we may doubt whether its soul, or
rather its ‘principate,’ is in the sun, as Cleanthes held<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, or in
the sky generally, as Chrysippus and Posidonius maintain<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>, or
in the aether, as Antipater of Tyre taught<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earth’s inhabitants.</div>

<p id="section203"><b>203.</b> In the study of the universe we are not called upon
merely to consider the earth as a member of the
celestial company; we have to contemplate it as
the home of beings of various ranks, which also display to us
the principle of orderly arrangement. Preëminent amongst the
inhabitants of the earth stands man, who is distinguished by
being the sole possessor of the faculty of reason, and in addition
owns all those capacities which are shewn in beings of lower
rank. The nature of man constitutes so large a part of philosophy
that we must reserve its full consideration for a special
chapter<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>; and must restrict ourselves here to treating of lower
beings, which fall into the three orders of animals, plants, and
inanimate beings. But since each of the higher orders possesses
all the properties of every order that stands lower, the study of
the orders inferior to man is also the study of a large part of
human nature. The number and classification of these orders
are not to be treated mechanically. From one point of view
gods and men form one class, the rational, as opposed to every
kind of non-rational being. On the other hand, from the standpoint
with which we are rather concerned at this moment, gods,
men, and animals are subdivisions of the order of animate beings,
below which stand the plants, and lower still things without life.
Animals, as the name indicates, possess life or soul; the two
lower orders possess something corresponding to soul, but lower
in degree. The general term which includes soul in the animal
and that which corresponds to it in the plants and in lifeless
bodies is ‘spirit’ (πνεῦμα); soul therefore is the highest type
of ‘spirit.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The animals have not reason</div>

<p id="section204"><b>204.</b> To the dumb animals the Stoics consistently deny the
faculty of reason; and this position must have
seemed to them self-evident, since the same word
Logos expresses in the Greek both reason and
speech. In the Latin the point was no longer so clear; still
the words ‘ratio’ and ‘oratio,’ if not identical, appeared to be
connected by a natural association. Since the animals then are
necessarily unreasoning, those acts of animals which appear to
show reason must be explained in some other way. A dog
pursues a wild animal by its scent; it must therefore be admitted
that in a way the dog recognises that ‘this scent is the sign of
the wild animal<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>’; still he is incapable of expressing this belief
in the form of a correct syllogism. The industry of the ant is
disposed of in a more summary way; this animal shows a ‘restless
helplessness,’ climbing up and down straws in meaningless
industry; many men however are no wiser<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. For their young
the animals have a certain feeling, yet their grief at losing them
is comparatively short-lived<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. In spite, however, of these limitations
the animal world is one part of the wonders of nature, and
is deserving of our admiration; all animals have strong affection
for their young so long as these need their protection<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, and the
dog deserves special recognition both for his keen intelligence
and for his loyalty towards his master<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">but a sort of reason.</div>

<p id="section205"><b>205.</b> To define more accurately the nature of animals we
must to some extent anticipate the discussion of
human nature in a later chapter, which follows the
same general lines: for in every point the animals are like men,
but inferior. They possess soul, but without reason<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>; by soul
we here mean the twin powers of observation and of independent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
movement<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. In a rough way the animals also possess a ruling
part<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. Their power of observation enables them to distinguish
what is healthful to them from that which is injurious; their
power of movement shapes itself into pursuit of the healthful
and avoidance of the injurious<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. They possess also properties
which resemble the human feelings, such as anger, confidence,
hope, fear; but they do not in a strict sense possess the same
feelings as men<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. As they cannot attain to virtue, neither can
they fall into vice<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plant life.</div>

<p id="section206"><b>206.</b> From the animals we pass to the plants. These seem
to have soul, because they live and die<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>; yet they
have not soul in any strict sense of the word. It
will therefore be better not to use this word, but to speak of the
‘growth-power’ (φύσις)<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. The governing part is situated in the
root<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. The growth of plants both in size and in strength is very
remarkable, inasmuch as little seeds, which at first find themselves
place in crevices, attain such power that they split huge
rocks and destroy noble monuments, thus illustrating what is
meant by tone or tension; for it is a spirit which starts from the
governing part (the root) and spreads to the trunk and branches,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
conveying a force equally strong to construct and to destroy<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.
From another point of view we may say that the seed contains
the Logos or law of the fully developed plant, for under no
possible circumstances can any other plant grow from that seed
except the plant of its kind<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cohesion.</div>

<p id="section207"><b>207.</b> Lowest in the scale come inanimate objects, such as
stones<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. Yet even these have a property which
corresponds to soul, and which keeps them together
in a particular outward form or shape; this property we call
‘cohesion’ (ἕξις, <i>unitas</i>)<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>; like soul itself, it is a spirit pervading
the whole<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>, and again it is the Logos of the whole. An external
force cannot impart this unity: so that the water contained in
a glass is not an ‘inanimate object’ in this sense<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. In this
lowest grade of ‘spirit’ we read in Stoicism the antithesis of
the materialism of Epicurus, who postulates for his ‘atoms’ the
fundamental property of indivisibility, and can only account for
the coherence of the bodies formed from them by supplying them
with an elaborate system of ‘hooks and eyes,’ which was a
frequent subject of derision to his critics. Epicurus makes the
indivisibility of the smallest thing his starting-point, and from
it constructs by degrees a compacted universe by arithmetical
combination; the Stoics start from the indivisibility of the great
whole, and working downwards explain its parts by a gradual
shedding of primitive force. God is in fact in the stone by
virtue of his power of universal penetration (κρᾶσις δι’ ὅλων)<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gradations of spirit.</div>

<p id="section208"><b>208.</b> No existing thing can possess one of the higher grades
of spirit without also possessing all the lower.
Stones therefore have cohesion, plants growth
and cohesion, animals soul growth and cohesion; for these are
not different qualities which can be combined by addition, but
appearances of the same fundamental quality in varying intensity.
Man clearly possesses cohesion, for he has an outward shape;
there does not however seem to be any part of him which has
merely cohesion. But in the bones, the nails, and the hair are
found growth and cohesion only, and these parts grow as the
plants do. In the eyes, ears and nose, are sensation, as well as
growth and cohesion; that is, there is soul in the sense in which
the animals possess soul. It is the intelligence only which in
man possesses soul in the highest grade<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conflagration.</div>

<p id="section209"><b>209.</b> This universe, in spite of its majesty, beauty and
adaptation, in spite of its apparent equipoise and
its essential divinity, is destined to perish. ‘Where
the parts are perishable, so is the whole; but the parts of the
universe are perishable, for they change one into another; therefore
the universe is perishable<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.’ Possibly this syllogism would
not have appeared so cogent to the Stoics, had they not long
before adopted from Heraclitus the impressive belief in the final
conflagration, familiar to us from its description in the ‘second
epistle of Peter<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.’ According to this theory, the interchange
of the elements already described<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> is not evenly balanced, but
the upward movement is slightly in excess. In the course of
long ages, therefore, all the water will have been converted into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
air and fire, and the universe will become hot with flame<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.
Then the earth and all upon it will become exhausted for want
of moisture, and the heavenly bodies themselves will lose their
vitality for want of the exhalations on which they feed. Rivers
will cease to flow, the earth will quake, great cities will be
swallowed up, star will collide with star. All living things will
die, and even the souls of the blest and the gods themselves
will once more be absorbed in the fire, which will thus regain
its primitive and essential unity<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. Yet we may not say that
the universe dies, for it does not suffer the separation of soul
from body<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is the universe perishable?</div>

<p id="section210"><b>210.</b> In connexion with the doctrine of the conflagration
the Stoics were called upon to take sides upon the
favourite philosophic problem whether the universe
is perishable, as Democritus and Epicurus hold, or
imperishable, as the Peripatetics say<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. In replying to this
question, as in the theory as a whole, they relied on the
authority of Heraclitus<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. The word universe is used in two
senses: there is an eternal universe (namely that already
described as the universal substance made individual by the
possession of quality<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>), which persists throughout an unending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
series of creations and conflagrations<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. In another sense the
universe, considered in relation to its present ordering, is perishable<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.
Just in the same way the word ‘city’ is used in two
senses; and that which is a community of citizens may endure,
even though the collection of temples and houses also called the
‘city’ is destroyed by fire<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissentient Stoics.</div>

<p id="section211"><b>211.</b> The doctrine of the conflagration was not maintained
by all Stoic teachers with equal conviction. Zeno
treated it with fulness in his book ‘on the universe<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>’;
and Cleanthes and Chrysippus both assert that the
whole universe is destined to change into fire, returning to that
from which, as from a seed, it has sprung<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. In the transition
period, owing to the positive influence of Plato and Aristotle,
and the critical acumen of Carneades, many leading Stoics
abandoned the theory<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. Posidonius however, though a pupil
of Panaetius (the most conspicuous of the doubters<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>), was quite
orthodox on this subject; though he pays to his master the
tribute of asserting that the universe is the most permanent
being imaginable<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>, and that its existence will continue through
an immense and <i>almost</i> unlimited period of time<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. In the
Roman period the conflagration is not only an accepted dogma,
but one that makes a strong appeal to the feelings. For with
the conflagration there comes to an end the struggle of the evil
against the good; and the Deity may at last claim for himself
a period of rest, during which he will contemplate with calmness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
the history of the universe that has passed away<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, and plan for
himself a better one to follow<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reconstruction.</div>

<p id="section212"><b>212.</b> Upon the conflagration will follow the reconstruction
of the world (παλιγγενεσία, <i>renovatio</i>), which will
lead again to a conflagration; the period between
one conflagration and the next being termed a ‘great year’
(περίοδος, <i>magnus annus</i>). The conception of the ‘great year’
was borrowed by the Stoics from the Pythagoreans<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, and leads
us back ultimately to astronomical calculations; for a great year
is the period at the end of which sun, moon and planets all
return to their original stations<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. The phenomena of the sky
recur in each new period in the same way as before; and hence
we readily infer that all the phenomena of the universe, including
the lives of individuals, will recur and take their course again.
Although this doctrine appears only slightly connected with the
general Stoic system, it was an accepted part of it: and Seneca
expresses an instinctive and probably universal feeling when he
says that few would willingly repeat their past histories, if they
knew they were so doing<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation.</div>

<p id="section213"><b>213.</b> We have put off till the end of this chapter the discussion
of the Stoic theory of Creation, because
it is in fact one of the least defined parts of the
system. According to the theory of the great year creation is
not a single work, but a recurring event; and therefore in one
sense the history of the universe has neither beginning nor end.
It would however be a mistake to suppose that this point of
view was always present to the minds of Stoic teachers. The
question of the beginning of things is of primary importance to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
every philosophy, and the Stoics approached it from many points
of view, popular, scientific, mythological and theological, and
gave a number of answers accordingly. To the orthodox Stoic
all these answers are ultimately one, though the language in
which they are expressed differs greatly; whilst the critic of
Stoicism would assert that they are derived from different
sources and are fundamentally irreconcileable. Seneca suggests
four answers to the question ‘Who made the universe?’ It may
be an omnipotent deity; or the impersonal Logos; or the divine
Spirit working in all things by tension; or (lastly) destiny, that
is, the unalterable succession of cause and result<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. These
answers we may examine in order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The golden age.</div>

<p id="section214"><b>214.</b> The view that ‘God made the world’ is that of the
theology which was now everywhere becoming
popular; and it is usually associated, even when
expounded by Stoic teachers, with dualistic views. Before the
creation there existed a chaos, matter without shape, dark and
damp<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>; the Deity formed a plan, and brought life order and
light into the mass: from ‘chaos’ it became ‘cosmos’<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. This
deity is the same that is commonly named Ζεύς<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> or Jove, and
is called the ‘father of gods and men.’ The universe so created
was at first happy and innocent, as is expressed in the tradition
of the Golden Age. Men lived together in societies, willingly
obeying the wisest and strongest of their number<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>; none were
tempted to wrong their neighbours. They dwelt in natural
grottos or in the stems of trees, and obtained nourishment
from tame animals and wild fruits. Little by little they made
progress in the arts, and learnt to build, to bake, and to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
use of metals. These views were especially developed by
Posidonius, who believed that in the Mysians of his day, who
lived on milk and honey, and abstained from flesh-meat, he
could still trace the manners of this happy epoch<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. It seems
probable that it was from Posidonius, rather than from the
Pythagoreans, that Varro derived his picture of the Golden Age,
which has become familiar to us in turn through the version
given by Ovid in his <i>Metamorphoses</i><a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Older stoic theory.</div>

<p id="section215"><b>215.</b> These conceptions however are only familiar in the
later forms of Stoicism. The teaching of the
founders of Stoicism is on this matter monistic,
and is based upon the teaching of Heraclitus that the world
was in the beginning a creative fire, which was alike the creator
and the material of creation. The process of creation (διακόσμησις)
may be regarded as identical with that of the mutation
of the elements on the downward path<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; with the special note
that when the stage of water is reached<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the deity assumes the
shape of the seed Logos (σπερματικὸς λόγος)<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, and begets in
the first instance the four elements<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>; then, from a combination
of these, trees and animals and all other things after their kind<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.
Yet even this statement is simplified if we regard the original
fire as itself containing the seed Logoi of all things that are to
be created<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. To this is to be added that all this is well ordered,
as in a duly constituted state<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. From this point of view the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Cosmos is a Cosmopolis, and we reach the border of the investigations
which deal with the moral government of the universe,
and the political organization of mankind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p id="section216"><b>216.</b> We may sum up the history of the universe according
to the Stoics somewhat in the following way.
Body is neither burden on the soul nor its
instrument, but all body is of itself instinct with motion, warmth,
and life, which are essentially the same. This motion is not
entirely that of contraction, or immobility would result; nor
entirely that of expansion, else the universe would be scattered
into the far distance<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. One of these motions constantly succeeds
the other, as Heraclitus says ‘becoming extinguished by measure,
and catching light by measure<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>’; as when a swimmer with all
his strength can just hold his own against the force of the stream,
or a bird straining its pinions appears to rest suspended in the
air<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. At the beginning of each world-period expansion or
tension is supreme, and only the world-soul exists. Next the
fiery breath begins to cool, the opposing principle of contraction
asserts itself, the universe settles down and shrinks; the aether
passes into air, and air in its turn to water. All this while
tension is slackening, first in the centre, lastly even in the
circumference; yet the vital force is not entirely quenched;
beneath the covering of the waters lurks the promise of a new
world. The fire still unextinguished within works upon the
watery mass or chaos until it evolves from it the four elements
as we know them. On its outer edge where it meets the expansive
aether, the water rarefies until the belt of air is formed.
All the while the outward and inward movements persist;
particles of fire still pass into air, and thence into water and
earth. Earth still in turn yields to water, water to air, and
air to fire (ὁδὸς ἄνω κάτω). Thus by the interaction of conflicting
tendencies an equilibrium (ἰσονομία) is established, and
the result is the apparent permanence of the phenomenal world<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
Finally the upward movement becomes slightly preponderant,
water becomes absorbed in air and air transformed into fire,
once more the conflagration results and all the world passes
into the fiery breath from which it came<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘mauvais pas.’</div>

<p id="section217"><b>217.</b> In the preceding chapter we have discussed the universe
from the scientific standpoint. ‘Such,’ say
the Stoics, ‘we find that the universe is; such and
such it was in the beginning, and such it will be to the end.’
Their conclusions are reached by observation, classification, and
analysis; and yet not entirely by these, for we must admit that
there is also employed that power of scientific imagination which
the ancients call ‘divination.’ Still on the whole the investigation
has been that of the student, and the method that of
speculation or contemplation dissociated from any consideration
of the usefulness of the results attained. In the study we now
undertake all this is changed. Our philosophy proceeds to
assert that the universe is good, that it is directed by wise
purpose, and that it claims the reverence and obedience of
mankind. It calls upon its adherents to view the world with
moral approval, and to find in it an ethical standard. Such
conclusions cannot be reached by purely discursive reason; but
they are such as are everywhere sought by practical men. They
appeal to a side of human nature different from that which
passes judgment on the conclusions previously reached. From
the first position ‘the universe is’ to the second ‘the universe is
good’ the step is slippery. We are on the dizzy heights of
philosophical speculation, where the most experienced climbers
find their way they know not how, and can hardly hold out a
hand to help those who are in distress. The Stoic teachers did
not perhaps always follow the same track, and now and again
they stumbled on the way. Reasoning often proved a weak
support, but resolution carried them through somehow to the
refuges on which their eyes were all along set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fate, providence, and fortune.</div>

<p id="section218"><b>218.</b> To the problem of the meaning and government of the
universe three answers were current in the epoch
with which we are dealing. Either all things take
place by fate; or the world is ruled by a divine
providence; or else fortune is supreme<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. These three terms are
not always mutually exclusive: Virgil speaks commonly of the
‘fates of the gods<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>’; and ‘fortune’ is frequently personified, not
only in common speech, as when the Romans spoke of the
‘fortune of the city,’ but even by a philosopher like Lucretius,
who speaks of ‘Fortune the pilot<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,’ with a half-humorous
abandonment of exactitude. The Stoics have the merit of
not only recognising fully these three powers, but also of using
the terms with relative consistency. By fate then we mean an
abstract necessity, an impersonal tendency, according to which
events flow; by providence a personal will; by fortune the absence
of both tendency and purpose, which results in a constant
shifting to and fro, as when a man stands upon a ball, and
is carried this way and that<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. All explanations, both of general
tendencies and of particular events, must ultimately resolve
themselves into one or other of these three; every constructive
system must necessarily aim at shewing that the three ultimately
coincide, and that philosophy is the guardian and guide of mankind
in the understanding of their relations one to another<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fate.</div>

<p id="section219"><b>219.</b> The Stoics hold that ‘all things happen by fate<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.’
To this conclusion they are brought by the same
reasoning that moved the Chaldaeans. The visible
universe is, and has motion. The heavenly bodies move incessantly
in their orbits; there is no force either within or without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
them that can turn them aside a hair’s breadth, or make their
pace quicker or slower. No prayers of men, no prerogatives of
gods can make them change<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. Without cause there is no effect;
and each effect is in its turn a new cause. Thus is constructed
an endless chain, in which all things living and inanimate are
alike bound. If a man knew all the causes that exist, he could
trace out all the consequences. What will be, will be; what will
not be, cannot be. This first Stoic interpretation of the universe
is that of Determinism; it reiterates and drives home the principle
that is here our starting-point, ‘the universe is.’ ‘Chrysippus,
Posidonius, and Zeno say that all things take place according to
fate; and fate is the linked cause of things that are, or the
system by which the universe is conducted<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.’ This ‘fate’ is only
another name for ‘necessity<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>’; fates cannot be changed<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘fallacies’ of determinism.</div>

<p id="section220"><b>220.</b> The doctrine of fate appears to contradict directly the
belief in human free will, and to lead up to the
practical doctrine of laziness (ἀργὸς λόγος, <i>ignava
ratio</i>). Once we allow it to be true that ‘what will be,
will be,’ it becomes useless to make any effort. As at the present
time, this argument was familiar in cases of sickness. One says
to the sick person, ‘if it is your fate to recover, then you will
recover whether you call in the physician or not; and if it is
your fate not to recover, then you will not recover in either case.
But it is your fate either to recover or not to recover; therefore
it will be useless to call in the physician.’ To which another
will reply: ‘you may as well argue that if it is your fate to beget
a son, you will beget one equally whether you consort with your
wife or not; therefore it will be useless to consort with your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
wife<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.’ With such verbal disputes Chrysippus delighted to
deal; his reply to the ‘lazy argument’ was that certain things
go together by fate (<i>iuncta fato, confatalia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Thus in the above
cases it may be determined by fate that you should both call
in a physician and recover, both consort with your wife and
beget a son.</p>

<p>So once more when Nestor says to the watchmen by his
ships:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Keep watch, my lads: let sleep seize no man’s eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest foes, loud laughing, take us by surprize<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some one then replies, ‘No, they will not, even if we sleep, if it
is predestined that the dock be not seized.’ To such an objection
any one can give the right answer: ‘all these things are equally
predestined, and go together by fate. There is no such thing
as a watch kept by sleepers, a victory won by runaways, or a
harvest reaped except after sowing good clean soil<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Logic of possibility.</div>

<p id="section221"><b>221.</b> The doctrine of fate also seems to conflict with some
of the commonest forms of speech. For if it is
correct to say ‘Either this will happen, or it will
not happen,’ it seems incorrect to say ‘it may happen’; and still
more of the past, since we must admit of any event that ‘it has
happened’ or ‘it has not happened,’ there seems no room for the
statement ‘it might have happened.’ Chrysippus however maintains
that the words ‘may’ and ‘might’ are correctly used, or
(in other words) that we may assert that it is or was ‘possible’
for things to happen, whether or not they will happen or have
happened. For example, the pearl here is breakable, and may
be broken, though fate has ordained that it never will be broken.
Cypselus might not have been tyrant of Corinth, though the
oracle at Delphi declared a thousand years before the time that
he would be<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. This view had been sharply contested by Diodorus
the Megarian; and the controversy was summed up in the
‘master argument.’ This is stated as follows: there are three
propositions in conflict with one another in the sense that if any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
two of them are true, the third is false. They are these: (i) every
past event is necessary; (ii) the impossible cannot follow on the
possible; (iii) there are things possible that neither are nor will
be true. Diodorus accepted the first two; he therefore drew the
conclusion that there is nothing possible except that which is
or will be true; or in other words he denied the existence of any
category of ‘things possible’ distinct from that of facts past or
future. Cleanthes and Antipater accepted the second and third
propositions: Chrysippus accepted the first and third, but denied
the second<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; that is he admitted that the possible thing (e.g. the
breaking of the pearl) might become the impossible because fate
had decided to the contrary. The choice intimates much; it
shows that the Stoics, however strongly they assert the rule
of fate or necessity, intend so to interpret these terms as to
reconcile them with the common use of words, that is, with the
inherited belief in divine and human will, breaking through the
chain of unending cause and effect<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definitions of fate.</div>

<p id="section222"><b>222.</b> The next step is professedly taken by way of definition
of the word ‘fate’ (εἱμαρμένη, <i>fatum</i>). Exactly as
the stuff of the universe, fire, has been explained
to be no mere passive or destructive element, but one possessed
of creative force and reason, so is fate declared to be no blind
or helpless sequence of events, but an active and wise power
which regulates the universe. Fate is in fact but another name
for the Logos or World-reason. On this point all Stoic teachers
are in the main agreed. ‘Fate,’ said Zeno, ‘is a power which
stirs matter by the same laws and in the same way; it may
equally well be called providence or nature<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.’ Chrysippus
gives us several alternative definitions: ‘the essence of fate is
a spiritual force, duly ordering the universe<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>’; it is ‘the Logos
of the universe<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>,’ or ‘the law of events providentially ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
in the universe<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>’; or, ‘the law by which things that have been
have been, that are are, that will be will be<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.’ But an important
difference appears between the views of Cleanthes and Chrysippus.
They are agreed that all that happens by providence also happens
by fate. But Cleanthes will not allow, as Chrysippus is prepared
to do, that all things that happen by fate happen providentially<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.
With Cleanthes the conception of fate is wider than that of
providence, just as in Virgil the fates are more powerful than
Jove. Cleanthes, being deeply conscious of the evil existing
in the universe, refused to hold providence responsible for it.
Chrysippus on the other hand identifies fate with the deity<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Providence.</div>

<p id="section223"><b>223.</b> Providence (πρόνοια, <i>providentia</i>) differs from fate, if
at all, by including an element of personality. It
is a principal dogma of the Stoics that ‘the universe
is ruled by providence.’ Cicero indeed assures us that the word
‘providence’ is merely an abbreviation for ‘the providence of
the gods,’ and that the dogma really asserts that ‘the universe
is ruled by the gods with foresight’; and Balbus, the Stoic
advocate, in his treatise, rebukes his opponent Cotta for having
travestied the Stoic doctrine by speaking of providence as ‘a
fortune-telling hag,’ as though she were some kind of goddess
governing the world<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. But the travesty is at least as instructive
as the exposition. If ‘providence’ is on the one hand interpreted
as God’s providence<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, it is on the other hand equivalent to
Nature<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, and again to the Mind of the universe; it is the Logos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
the universal Law, the creative force<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; not merely an attribute,
but a manifestation and bodily presentment of deity. After the
final conflagration three joining in one will be left, Zeus, providence,
and the creative fire<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Lastly, if we consider the process
of logical demonstration, it is from the reality of providence that
the Stoics deduce the existence of the gods; only from the
standpoint of dogmatic instruction is the order reversed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beauty of the universe.</div>

<p id="section224"><b>224.</b> The work and functions of Providence are open to our
view, for it has an aim and pathway of its own<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.
Its first aim is to create a universe capable of
enduring; next, it makes that universe complete; thirdly, it
endows it with every beauty and excellence<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. The beauty
of the world is a favourite theme upon which Stoic orators
discourse at length; this is, in their view, the best world that
could possibly have been created<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. This sense of beauty
appears to be derived from two sources, the admiration and
awe felt in contemplating the sky, the sun moon and stars
moving in it, lofty mountains, rushing rivers, and deep caves<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>;
and the gentler delight stirred by the sight of the fertile field,
the vine-clad hill, the river-pathway, the flocks and herds, which
all subserve the convenience of man. Thus from beauty we
pass to usefulness, and the Stoics now maintain that the world
has been created and is maintained for the use of man<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. In
strict language, however, we must say that the universe is made
for the use of rational beings, that is, for gods and men<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
it is a home or city in which gods and men alike have a share<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.
From the protection of providence the animals, according to the
Stoic view, are in principle entirely excluded. Yet it did not
escape notice that nature has often provided for their comfort
in particulars, giving them instincts that enable them to maintain
life, and an outward shape conformable to the conditions of their
existence<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. And Seneca especially found that man was apt to
swell himself too greatly, as if that world were made for him, of
which only a small part is adapted for him to dwell in, and
where day and night, summer and winter would continue of
themselves, even if no man observed them<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. On the other
hand zealots like Chrysippus worked out the detailed application
of this theory in a way that provoked the amusement of
their critics<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Particular providence.</div>

<p id="section225"><b>225.</b> Providence cares for mankind in general, and therefore
for the parts of mankind, the various continents,
nations, and cities. The Stoics are also inclined to
hold that it cares for the individual<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. The difficulty of this belief
is great. Busy cities are overthrown by the earthquake; the
crops of the careful farmer are blasted by the hailstorm; Socrates
is condemned to death by the Athenians; Pythagoras, Zeno and
Antiphon meet with violent ends. Yet we may not think that
in any of these cases the sufferers were hated or neglected by
the gods; it is rather an inevitable necessity that has worked
their ruin. The gods who have great things in their charge,
must sometimes overlook small matters; they must save the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
community by sacrificing the individual<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. The storm may rage
in the valley, yet there is peace on the mountain heights<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. The
philosopher who is absorbed in contemplating the great whole
cannot even see the flaws in its details. ‘If the gods care for
all men,’ says Cicero’s authority, ‘it follows logically that they
care for each single man<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.’ ‘Nothing occurs on earth, nor in
the heaven above, nor in the sea, apart from thee, O God,’ sings
Cleanthes<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. ‘It is impossible,’ says Chrysippus, ‘that even the
least of particulars can fall out otherwise than in accordance
with the will of God, with his Word, with law, with justice, and
with providence<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Existence of evil.</div>

<p id="section226"><b>226.</b> The doctrine of providence, carried to a logical extreme,
leads to the denial of the existence of evil. But
the Stoics did not draw this conclusion; had they
done so, their whole treatment of ethics would have become
futile. We have therefore to scrutinize carefully the language
that they employ. If we meet with the paradox that ‘this is
the best of all possible worlds,’ we must remember that all
paradoxes need for their interpretation some sense of humour,
and that the ‘best possible’ is not the same as the ‘best imaginable.’
Somewhere or other there is, in a sense, a limitation to
the sphere of providence. If again in poetical passages we learn
that ‘nothing occurs without God,’ we must not forget the
doctrine that good and evil are alike brought in the end into
harmony with the divine nature. The most exact statement of
Stoic doctrine would seem to be that evil exists indeed, but is
not the equal of the good either in intensity or in duration; it
is an incident, not a first principle of the universe<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. From this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
point of view it becomes possible to ‘plead the cause of the gods,’
to defend providence from the heavy accusations men bring
forward against it<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Thus the Stoics set about to prove that,
in spite of the existence of evil, the universe is ruled by the
foresight of a beneficent deity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Logical solutions.</div>

<p id="section227"><b>227.</b> The first argument for the defence is logical, and is
pressed by Chrysippus. Good implies its opposite,
evil. ‘There could be no justice, unless there were
also injustice; no courage, unless there were cowardice; no truth,
unless there were falsehood<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.’ Just in the same way we find
coarse wit in a comedy, which is objectionable in itself, and yet
somehow contributes to the charm of the poem as a whole<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.
The second argument is based upon the doctrine of ‘necessary
consequence’ (παρακολούθησις). The general design of the
human head required that it should be compacted of small and
delicate bones, accompanying which is the inevitable disadvantage
that the head may easily be injured by blows<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. War is an
evil, but it turns to good by ridding the world of superfluous
population<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p>In many other cases there may be explanations that are
beyond our present knowledge, just as there are many kinds
of animals of which we do not yet know the use<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral solutions.</div>

<p id="section228"><b>228.</b> More important are those arguments which introduce
moral considerations. In the first place the generous
intentions of providence are often thwarted by the
perverseness of wicked men<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, just as many a son uses his inheritance
ill, and yet his father in bequeathing it to him did him
a service<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. The Deity treats good men as a Roman father his
children, giving them a stern training, that they may grow in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
virtue<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>; those that he loves, he hardens<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. Earthquakes and
conflagrations may occur on earth, and perhaps similar catastrophes
in the sky, because the world needs to be purified from
the wickedness that abounds<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. The punishment of the wicked,
for instance by pestilence and famine, stands for an example to
other men, that they may learn to avoid a like disaster<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. Often,
if the wicked have gone unpunished, the penalty descends on
their children, their grandchildren, and their descendants<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divine power limited.</div>

<p id="section229"><b>229.</b> The very multiplicity of these explanations or excuses
betrays the weakness of the case, and the Stoics are
in the last resort driven to admit that the Deity is
neither all-knowing nor all-powerful, and that the
sphere of providence is limited by an all-encircling necessity.
Thus Chrysippus explains blunders in divination by saying that
‘the Deity cannot know everything<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>,’ and though he ascribes to
the Deity all power, yet when hard pressed he admits that he
cannot do everything, and that ‘there is a good deal of necessity
in the matter<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.’ In this way he is forced back to the position
which the shrewder Cleanthes had taken from the first<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. After
we have taken away from fate all that has life or meaning,
there remains a residuum, which we can but vaguely assign to
some ‘natural necessity<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.’ This point once granted, we realize
that it includes many of the detailed explanations previously
given. Thus it is by ‘natural necessity’ that good cannot exist
without evil; that the past cannot be altered; that the one
must suffer for the many<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>; that the good cannot always be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
separated from the bad<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; that character grows by the defiance
of pain; that the individual is everywhere exposed to disaster
from tyranny, war, pestilence, famine, and earthquake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">God and men allied.</div>

<p id="section230"><b>230.</b> The recognition of the limitations of divine power
creates a new tie between gods and men. Men
are no longer the mere instruments of providence,
they are its fellow-workers; we may even go further, and boldly
call them its fellow-sufferers<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. God has given man what he
could, not what he would<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; he could not change the stuff on
which he had to work<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; if anything has not been granted to
us, it could not have been granted<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Under such circumstances
a sensible man will not find fault with the gods, who have done
their best<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; nor will he make appeals to them to which they
cannot respond<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Even less will he quarrel with a destiny that
is both blind and deaf<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fortune.</div>

<p id="section231"><b>231.</b> In the Stoic explanation of the universe fortune plays
no part; it has no existence in the absolute sense
of the term<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. But in practical life, and from the
limited point of view of the individuals concerned, fortune is
everywhere met with. Her actions are the same as we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
just seen to be ascribed to ‘natural necessity’; storms, shipwrecks,
plagues, wars, and tyranny<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. Fortune therefore by no
means excludes causality, but includes all events which are
without meaning from the point of view of the individual<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>;
all advantages or disadvantages which he has not personally
merited, and which are not designed for his individual discipline.
So great is the sphere of Fortune, that it appears at first that she
is mistress of human life; and we may picture her as a tyrant,
mocking and merciless, without principle and without policy<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
The further consideration of Fortune belongs to the department
of Ethics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Has God or man free will?</div>

<p id="section232"><b>232.</b> The supreme problems of philosophy, in their relation
to gods and men, the fellow-citizens of this universe,
centre in the question of free will. If we grant that
the divine power is to some extent less in range than
the power of necessity, does it still remain open to us to attribute
to it within that range some real choice between alternatives,
something of that individual power which common opinion
attributes to kings? or must we on the other hand regard the
divinity as a mere symbol of an unchanging law, girt with the
trappings of a royalty from which all real share in government
has been withdrawn? Is man again a mere puppet under the
control either of fate or of fortune, or has he too some share in
creating the destiny to which he must submit? Supposing him
to have this power of will, is it bound up with his privilege of
reason, or do the animals also possess it?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoics incline towards free will.</div>

<p id="section233"><b>233.</b> To such questions the Stoics do not give the direct
answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No.’ The critics who wish to tie
them down to one or other of the opposing views
complain that they wriggle and grow flushed and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
excited about their answer<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. They accept apparently both
views as dogmas, asserting that ‘all things take place by destiny’
and that ‘something rests with us<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.’ To the first dogma the
whole of their treatment of physics points; but the second is
required as a postulate for any science of ethics<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[78a]</a>. The Stoics
were in no way disposed to cut the knot by sacrificing one or
the other of the principal parts of their philosophy. They go
back upon the terms in which the questions are propounded,
and endeavour by fresh investigation and more precise definition
to do away with the obvious contradiction. In this work they
were observed to have a bias in favour of free will<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. The first
sign of this bias we have already noticed in the vindication of
the word ‘possible<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.’ If our eyes are fixed merely on the movement
of the heavenly bodies, we shall hardly need a term which
prints on future events a character which it denies to those that
are past. The astronomer can describe to us with equal precision
an eclipse taking place a thousand years before the battle of
Salamis or a thousand years after. But the word ‘possible’
opens the door to the emotions of hope and fear, to the sense
of right and wrong, with regard to the whole range of future
events. However delicately the doctrine may be shaded, the
main issue is determined when we say of gods and men that
they ‘can<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Proximate and principal causes.</div>

<p id="section234"><b>234.</b> In order to reconcile the doctrines of causality and
possibility, we must first distinguish between outer
and inner compulsion, between ‘proximate’ and
‘principal’ causes. If a boy starts a cylinder
rolling down hill, he gives it an opportunity without which it
could not have rolled; this is the proximate cause (προκαταρκτική,
<i>proxima</i>). But the cylinder would not continue rolling
except by an inner compulsion, a law within itself, by which it
is the nature of cylinders to roll downwards<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. This is the leading
or principal cause (προηγουμένη, <i>antecedens</i> or <i>principalis</i>). So
neither in thought nor in action can a man form a judgment,
unless there be a picture (φαντασία, <i>visum</i>) presented to his
mind. The picture is a proximate cause<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. But assent to the
picture rests with the man himself; the man himself, his reason,
his will, is the principal cause. Here we touch on the dogma
which is the foundation of ethics: ‘assent is in our power.’
Upon this rests the right of the philosopher to praise or blame,
the right of the lawgiver to reward and punish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The divine nature immutable.</div>

<p id="section235"><b>235.</b> We have to investigate further the inner compulsion,
the principal cause. With regard to the gods
their own disposition is a law to them, their character
holds them to their purpose, their majesty
makes their decrees immutable<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. This is the final answer of
philosophy, even though men cannot content themselves with it.
Even amongst those most disposed to accept Stoic principles,
there is a wish that the gods should be allowed a little <i>play</i>,
a choice at any rate in small matters not hampered by considerations
of destiny and morality<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>; and upon this issue the poet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
may deviate a little from the sterner creed of the philosopher<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.
Nor must we so interpret the wisdom and benevolence of the
gods as to deny the efficacy of prayer<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man’s wickedness.</div>

<p id="section236"><b>236.</b> In the case of men free will comes accompanied by
a heavy burden of responsibility; for by its exercise
men have defied the gods and brought evil
into the world. In vain they accuse the gods and destiny, when
their own perverseness has exaggerated their destiny, as Homer
bears witness:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Lo you now, how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us
they say comes evil, whereas they even of themselves, through the blindness
of their own hearts, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘Through the blindness of their own hearts they perished, fools<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Equally in vain it is that they protest against the penalties
prescribed by the lawgiver for acts to which they allege fate has
drawn them<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Of their wrongdoing the ‘principal cause’ lies
in their own natures; if these are from the first wholesome, the
blows of fate are deadened; if they are boorish and undisciplined,
they rush of themselves into sin and error<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. Into the further
question, whether a man is responsible for his own nature, our
authorities do not enter. It is sufficient that in ethics a way
will be pointed out, by which all men, if only they consent to
undergo the necessary training, may bring their wills into harmony
with the will of the universe. As to the animals, they
act upon impulse, but cannot be said in a strict sense to possess
will, nor are they proper subjects for praise and blame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">No result without cause.</div>

<p id="section237"><b>237.</b> Thus free will, which at first sight appears equivalent
to the negation of cause, is by the Stoics identified
with the highest type of cause. Action without
cause (τὸ ἀναίτιον), effect which is self-caused (τὸ
αὐτόματον), are totally denied<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. Even if a man be given the
choice between two actions which appear exactly equivalent,
as when he must begin walking either with the right or with
the left foot, there is always a cause which determines between
them, though (as in all cases of ‘chance’) it is not discernible by
human reasoning<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. In this way destiny, cause, will are all
brought into harmony; the dualism (which after all cannot be
entirely avoided) is thrust out of sight. ‘All things take place
according to destiny, but not all things according to necessity<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>’;
thus is saved the principle of free choice (τὸ ἐφ’ ἡμῖν). In other
words, the Stoic fixes his attention on the pulsating, living, willing
powers of the universe, and refuses to dwell upon any blind non-moral
unbending ‘necessity’ of things, even whilst he admits that
such necessity is there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pons Stoicus.</div>

<p id="section238"><b>238.</b> Now that the various steps have been decided upon,
by which our philosophy progresses from physics
to ethics, it remains to connect them by a pathway
in the form of a chain of reasoning. We cannot affirm that the
steps have been reached by any logical process, or that the show
of reasoning makes them any safer to tread in. But the logical
form is a convenient method of impressing dogmatic instruction
on the memory, and if it cannot remove difficulties inherent in
the subject-matter, it at least so distributes them that they may
be overlooked by the zealous and defied by the adventurous.
Thus then the argument runs:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘If all things are determined by fate, then the ordering of the universe
must be smooth and unhindered; if this is so, there must be an ordered
universe; and if so, there must be gods. Now if there are gods, the gods
are good; and if they are good, goodness exists; and if goodness exists, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
also does wisdom. And goodness and wisdom are the same for gods and
for men<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. If this is so, there must be a science of things to be done and
to be avoided, that is of right actions and of sins. But right actions are
praiseworthy, and sins blameable. Things praiseworthy deserve reward,
and things blameable deserve punishment.</p>

<p>Therefore if all things are determined by fate, there must be rewards
and punishments<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>All this chain of argument is convincing to the man who is
already a Stoic; to his opponent it seems to display its weakness
at every joint.</p>

<p id="section239"><b>239.</b> We now turn from the supreme problems of philosophy
to the formulation of religious belief and practice.
A complete change comes over the spirit of our
study. Until now we have been reaching out to observe, to
define in words, to coordinate in a monistic system every object,
every statement, every generalisation of which the human mind
can rightly take account. We have kept eyes and ears open to
learn from the East and from the West, from the idealist and the
materialist, from the poet and from the critic. At last we have
reached our highest point in the dogmas of the providential
ordering of the universe and the moral obligation of the individual
man; dogmas which, as we have seen, are expounded in
logical form, but are essentially such as logic can neither establish
nor refute. Stoicism, having once breathed in the mountain
air of supreme principles, now begins to descend to the plains of
common life, and to find the due application of its theories in the
ordering of practical affairs. The theory of religion is treated
as the first stage in this downward path; it is the adaptation of
philosophy to the language of social life and individual aspiration.
By ‘religion’ we mean here the theory of the existence
and character of the gods; the practice of ceremonies in their
honour and of prayers for their favour; and further, the theory
and practice of divination. Upon all these questions philosophy
sits as the supreme judge: external authority, embodied in the
traditions of Greece and Rome respectively, may claim consideration,
but not submission, from the intellect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical changes of view.</div>

<p id="section240"><b>240.</b> In this attitude of the Stoics towards religion we can
easily distinguish certain historical changes. Zeno
represents in the main the critical temper; his tone
is revolutionary and atheistic; he contemplates the
entire subversion of existing religious practices to make room
for a purer system. The principles of Cleanthes are the same,
but finer expression in a more cheerful spirit; he has no bitterness
as to the present, and much confidence in the future. With
Chrysippus there sets in a tide of reconciliation; the ingenuities
of etymology and allegorical interpretation are set to work to
prove that the old religion contains, at least in germ, the substance
of the new. The practical dangers of this method are
obvious, and have not escaped the notice of the critics of Stoicism.
It may be well to smoothe the path of the convert by allowing
him to use old formulas and practices with a new meaning; it
is not so easy to excuse the acceptance of a purely formal conversion,
by which philosophy enrols as its nominal adherents
men who give it no real submission, and increases its numbers
at the cost of its sincerity. Posidonius stands out as the type
of this weakness; with him begins the subordination of philosophic
principle to religious sentiment. In the first period of
Roman Stoicism the struggle was acute; many of the Stoics
had the courage to defy the inherited prejudices of their fellow-countrymen,
others bowed before the storm. Those who condemn
the Stoics in a body as having sacrificed their convictions, in
order that they might hold the honoured and lucrative positions
of defenders of the national religion<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, show a lack both of
sympathy and of critical discernment. All through the Roman
period the Stoics held in theory a definite and consistent position,
which will be expounded in this chapter; in the application of
their principles to practical problems they showed that variation
of standard and temperament which history has always to record
even of societies of honourable and intelligent men. But it must
be admitted that as the Stoics increase in numbers, their devotion
to vital principles grows weaker, till at last we recognise in
Marcus Aurelius both the most critical of Stoic thinkers, and the
man in whom the powers of thought are most definitely subjected
to the play of old associations and prejudices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dogmas of natural religion.</div>

<p id="section241"><b>241.</b> The theoretic teaching of the Stoics upon theology
follows a very definite programme. Four dogmas
need to be established: (i) that gods exist; (ii) that
they are living, benevolent, and immortal; (iii) that
they govern the universe; and (iv) that they seek the good of
men. To each of these dogmas is attached a series of ‘proofs,’
such as are still in vogue as ‘evidences of natural religion<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.’
The whole of this body of teaching may be treated by us as an
exposition in popular language of the central dogma that ‘the
universe is ordered by providence.’ We have therefore first to
consider whether the language used is really appropriate to the
philosophic position, or whether it concedes too much to accepted
beliefs. Secondly we have to consider whether the ‘proofs’
employed really correspond to the monistic point of view as
understood by the Stoics, or whether dualisms abandoned in
principle are regaining their old position in connexion with practical
problems. Now the third and fourth dogmas, so far as
they add to the first two, import nothing more than the general
doctrine of providence. The first two dogmas, taken together,
substitute for the abstract term ‘providence’ the more concrete,
and (as we should phrase it) the more personal conception of a
‘god’ or ‘gods.’ The supreme question of the Stoic religion is
therefore whether these terms are rightly used; and it falls into
two parts, the use of the singular ‘god,’ carrying with it associations
derived from Persism and Judaism; and the use of the
plural ‘gods,’ which carries with it a qualified approval of the
polytheism of the Greek and Roman pantheons. In accordance
with the general principles of our philosophy, the wider question
must be first determined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ‘nature’ of gods.</div>

<p id="section242"><b>242.</b> The ‘gods,’ according to the Stoics, form a ‘natura,’ a
department of the universe, a category including
one or more individuals. Hence the title of Cicero’s
work, ‘de natura deorum’; that is, ‘of the class of beings called
gods.’ Each department of philosophy, according to the Stoic
interpretation, brings us in the end into touch with this world
of deities. In dialectics we are led up to the supreme Reason,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
the Logos or Word, whose divine being permeates the universe<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
Metaphysics point us to Body in the purest form<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; to Spirit
which reaches from end to end of the universe<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; to a first Cause,
a Cause of causes, the initial link in the unending chain of
events<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. If we look to the elements in their unceasing interchange,
we find deity in all things that shift and suffer metamorphosis,
in water, in earth, and in air<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; how much more then
in fire, which in one aspect is the purest of the elements, and in
another is the creative rational substance from which the whole
universe issues<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>? God is indeed the universe, and all that is in
it, though not in the pantheistic sense that he is evenly diffused
throughout all things<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. Look towards this earth, which lies at
the centre of the world-order; even in its most repulsive contents,
in its grossest matter, there is deity<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Lift up your eyes
to the heavens; God is the all-encircling sea of fire called
Aether<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; he is sun<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and stars<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Consider the universe in its
history; God is its creator<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, its ruler, its upholder<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. Analyze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
it; he is its soul<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, its mind<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. Strain your sight to perceive the
meaning of all things: he is fate<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; he is nature<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; he is providence;
he is necessity<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. And if we look forward to the problems
of politics and ethics, we must say that God is the Universal Law
that calls for the reverence of gods and men as a community<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,
and equally demands, under the name of conscience, the unhesitating
obedience of the individual<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. Lastly, in the history of
mankind, in its great men and useful discoveries, the Stoic
masters recognised the element of divinity<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. In the language
of to-day, God is the pole in which all the parallels of human
inquiry merge, the <i>x</i> of the problem of the universe, the unknown
that is known in his works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unity of God.</div>

<p id="section243"><b>243.</b> That God is one is a doctrine which the Stoics take
over from the Cynics<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> (who therein follow Socrates),
and from the general opinion; without making this
a formal dogma, they constantly assume it tacitly by using the
term ‘God’ (ὁ θεός, <i>deus</i>). With equal readiness they accept in
use plural and abstract nouns for the same conception, as <i>di immortales</i>,
<i>vis divina</i>. The interpretation of this apparent conflict
of language must be found in the general principles of the Stoic
monism. Just as the elements are four, and yet are all the
creative fire in its changing shapes: just as the virtues are
many, and yet there is but one Virtue appearing under different
circumstances: so there is but one Deity, appearing under many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
names<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. This view the assailants of Stoicism reduce to the
absurdity that some Stoic gods are created and mortal, whilst
others are uncreated<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; and again that Zeus is worse than a
Proteus, for the latter changed into a few shapes only and those
seemly, whilst Zeus has a thousand metamorphoses, and there is
nothing so foul that he does not in turn become<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. No one however
who is familiar with the many points of view from which
Greek philosophers approach the problem of ‘the one and the
many’ will be readily disturbed by this rather superficial
criticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeus.</div>

<p id="section244"><b>244.</b> In its practical application the belief in the one-ness
of God assimilated itself to the worship of the
Greek Ζεύς and the Latin Jove or Juppiter. It
would be impossible within the limits of this work to trace the
growth of monotheistic feeling in the Greco-Roman world in
connexion with the names of these two deities, which in the
mythologies are members of societies. We have already suggested
that the most direct impulse came from Persism: but in
connexion with Roman history it is important to notice that a
similar impulse arrived through the Tuscan religion<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. The
nature of the Stoic worship of Zeus is abundantly illustrated
by the <i>Hymn</i> of Cleanthes<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; the intimate sense of companionship
between Zeus and his worshipper comes to light, perhaps
with a tinge of Cynic sentiment, in all the discourses of Epictetus.
A special emphasis is laid on the fatherhood of Zeus. This
attribute could be traced back to the poems of Homer, and is
prominent throughout Virgil’s <i>Aeneid</i><a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. It can be explained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
in connexion with the growth of all living substances<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, but has
a more lofty meaning in that man alone shares with the gods
the inheritance of reason<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. But the Homeric association of
Zeus with mount Olympus entirely disappears in Stoicism in
favour of the Persian conception of a god dwelling in heaven<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
Further the Stoics agree with the Persians that this god must
not be thought of as having the form of any animal or man<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>;
he is without form<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, but capable of assuming all forms<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definition of ‘god.’</div>

<p id="section245"><b>245.</b> In the Stoic system the conception of godhead as one
and supreme much exceeds in importance the conception
of a multiplicity of gods. We may therefore
reasonably consider at this point the four dogmas of the Stoic
theology. The first point to be examined is the definition of the
word ‘god.’ As adopted by the Stoic school generally it runs
thus: ‘a rational and fiery spirit, having no shape, but changing
to what it wills and made like to all things<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.’ This definition
corresponds satisfactorily to the Stoic system of physics; but
even so we must notice that the statement ‘God is necessity<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>’
is an exaggeration, since ‘necessity’ is entirely devoid of the
qualities of reasonableness and plasticity. We find a different
definition in Antipater of Tarsus, which is emphasized by the
Stoics of the transition period generally:—‘God is a living being,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
blessed, imperishable, the benefactor of mankind<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.’ This definition
points clearly the way to the Stoic system of religion. The
difference between the two definitions marks then the step that
has here to be taken. There is an accentuation of the property
of personality; we pass from a ‘rational spirit’ to a ‘living being.’
There is the addition of a moral quality; we pass from a plastic
substance to a beneficent will. The existence of deity in the
first sense has been displayed to us by our whole analysis of the
universe; it is with regard to the existence of deity in the second
sense that we need the constant support of the dogma of providence,
expounded in the technical proofs which we now proceed
to examine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gods exist: the proof from consent.</div>

<p id="section246"><b>246.</b> The first Stoic dogma is ‘that gods exist’; and of this
the first and most familiar ‘proof’ is that which
depends upon common consent. Amongst all men
and in all nations there is a fixed conviction that
gods exist; the conception is inborn, indeed we may say graven
on the minds of all men<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. To this proof the Stoics attach the
highest possible importance; but its justification, as we have
seen, presents great difficulties<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. Cleanthes, the most religiously
minded of the early Stoics, had not troubled to conceal his contempt
for the opinions of the crowd<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>; and the ridiculous belief
in Tartarus<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> is as widespread as that in the gods. Here then
we must distinguish; it is not sufficient that a conception should
be universal, if it appeals most to foolish folk, and even so is decaying<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.
We must not however at this moment inquire into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
causes of this belief<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>; for this is to pass from the question at
issue to other proofs of the dogma. It seems clear that the
value of this particular proof depends upon the Stoic doctrine
of ‘inborn conceptions,’ which we have already discussed<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
Without going over the whole ground again, the substance of
the argument as applied to the present question may be thus
stated. The mind of each individual man is by descent akin
to the universal reason (κοινὸς λόγος, <i>universa ratio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Therefore
all men carry with them from their birth predispositions in
favour of certain preconceptions; and the fact that these preconceptions
are common to all is evidence of their divine origin.
These predispositions by the growth and training of the individual
on the one hand, by his contact with the outer world on
the other hand through the organs of sense, ripen into reason.
Now all men are born with a predisposition to explain what is
beyond their own reasoning powers by the hypothesis of a living
and reasoning agent. The belief in gods is therefore a ‘preconception’;
and if it is confirmed by growth and experience, it
must be of divine origin and therefore self-proving. In the
language of our own times, the belief in deity cannot be dispensed
with as a working hypothesis; its omission lames human
reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The proof of the ‘higher Being.’</div>

<p id="section247"><b>247.</b> The second proof ‘that gods exist’ is particularly
associated with the name of Chrysippus; it may
be summed up by saying ‘there must be a Being
higher than man.’ We begin by assuming that
reason is the highest power in the universe<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>; an axiom which
is always subject to limitation on account of the existence of
‘natural necessity.’ According to the Stoics, reason is common
to gods and men; if, for the sake of argument, this is denied,
then reason is possessed by men alone, for we can certainly find
no better name than ‘god’ for higher reasoning beings<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
then there exists something greater than human reason can
produce, it must be the work of some reasoning being greater
than man, that is, it must be the work of the gods. But the
heavenly constellations are such a work; therefore they are the
work of the gods, and therefore gods exist<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. To this argument
two others are supplementary. First, human reason itself must
be derived from some source, and what other can we name
but the deity<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>? Secondly, if there are no gods, man must be
the supreme being; but such a claim is an arrogant infatuation<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
The same arguments are attributed in substance to Zeno<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; nay,
so cogent are they that they are in part accepted even by
Epicurus<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The proofs from the elements and the universe.</div>

<p id="section248"><b>248.</b> There follow two proofs connected with gradations
in the scale of being. Earth and water are the
two lower and grosser elements; and since temperament
depends greatly upon climate, we find that
men and the animals are all of somewhat heavy character. Air
and fire are the higher and more refined elements; how then
can we think otherwise than that they are the home of more
lofty beings<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>? Then again the universe is either a simple or a
composite body. That it is not composite is shown by the
harmony (συμπάθεια, <i>concentus</i>) of its parts; it is therefore
simple. A simple body must be held together by spirit in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
one of its grades, either as unity, growth, or soul. Bodies held
together merely by unity, like stones or logs, admit of very
simple changes only; but the universe admits of every kind of
change and development, and yet keeps together; it must therefore
be held together by spirit in its highest grade, that is by
soul and by reason. Being a whole, it must be greater than its
parts, and include all that its parts possess. But a nature greater
than man, and possessing soul and reason, is god<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The proof from providence.</div>

<p id="section249"><b>249.</b> The proof from the good gifts of providence has been
already given in substance; we may however notice
the sharp reply given to Epicurus, who maintains
that the wondrous contrivances of the Creator for
the benefit of man result from the chance clashings of particles.
‘As well contend,’ replies the Stoic, ‘that words and verses come
from the chance shifting of the twenty-one letters of the alphabet,
and that the poems of Ennius could be produced by shaking
together a sufficient quantity of these in a box, and then pouring
them out on the ground! Chance would hardly produce a
single verse<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.’ The terrors of the universe, its storms, earthquakes,
deluges, pestilences and wars, which seem to militate
against this proof, are themselves turned into a fourth proof<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.
A further proof, which depends on the contemplation of the
movements of the heavenly bodies<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, we have sufficiently considered
in connexion with the influence of Chaldaean and Persian
thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The proof from worship.</div>

<p id="section250"><b>250.</b> There remain two proofs, which at first sight may
appear singular, but are nevertheless very strongly
urged, the proofs from worship and divination;
which according to the Stoics are practices
that must be justified, but cannot be justified without the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
postulate of the existence of gods. The proof from worship is
best known in the paradoxical form, ‘if there are altars, there
are gods,’ which is attributed to Chrysippus<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. This proof is fused
by Seneca with the proof from general consent<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>; but its true
character seems to be different. ‘Without gods there can be no
piety, for piety is the right worship of the gods. Without gods
there can be no holiness, for holiness is a right attitude towards
the gods. Without gods there can be no wisdom, for wisdom is
the knowledge of things human and divine<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. But without piety,
holiness, and wisdom a reasonable philosophy cannot be constructed.
Therefore gods exist.’ The argument in its simplest
form is attributed to Zeno himself. ‘It is reasonable to honour
the gods. But it is not reasonable to honour the non-existent.
Therefore gods exist<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The proof from divination.</div>

<p id="section251"><b>251.</b> The final argument is that from divination; which is
remarkable in view of the close association between
divination and astrology, and the derivation of the
latter from a scientific system which finds no place
for divine interpositions. But both in Greece and Rome the forecasting
of the future had long been reconciled with theology,
upon the hypothesis that the gods warn men for their good of
coming events. In accepting the truth of divination the Stoics
were following the Socratic tradition<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. This belief was accepted
by all the great Stoic masters, and was a ‘citadel’ of their
philosophy<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. It is true that on this point Panaetius exercised
the privilege of a suspense of judgment<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; but all the more did
his pupil, the pious Posidonius, lay stress upon the subject, on
which he composed five books<a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>, of which the spirit is preserved
to us in Cicero’s books <i>de Divinatione</i><a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. To Roman writers their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
inherited State practice of augury, with its elaborate though
half-forgotten science, was long a motive for maintaining this
belief<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; but the ancient reputation of the oracle at Delphi
maintained its hold still more persistently, and was abandoned
with even greater reluctance<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Nevertheless the whole group of
beliefs was quietly pushed aside by the Romans of the times of
the empire, if we may judge from the words of Epictetus—‘what
need have I to consult the viscera of victims and the flight of
birds, and why do I submit when he (the diviner) says “it is
for your interest?” Have I not within me a diviner<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>?’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divine qualities.</div>

<p id="section252"><b>252.</b> Our next enquiry is ‘of what kind are the gods?’
‘what are their qualities?’ Here the Stoics break
more decidedly with tradition. Antipater of Tarsus,
as we have seen, defined the deity as ‘a living being, happy,
immortal and benevolent towards men<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.’ It is clear that this
description can only be applied in its fulness to the supreme
deity, for all other gods are destined to pass away in the general
conflagration<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. That the supreme deity is possessed of life and
of reason has already been assumed in the proofs of his existence;
but we have here a reaffirmation of Stoic doctrine as against
those that hold that the world is governed by blind destiny and
chance. In stating that the gods are happy the Stoics agree
with Epicurus; but according to them this happiness consists
not in rest, but in activity. In this distinction the whole
difference between the Stoic and Epicurean ideals of happiness,
that is, between their ethical ends, comes into sight. The Stoics
affirm that the gods are occupied, and that with matters of the
greatest concern: and that any other conception is unworthy
of them<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. That the activity of the gods has for its aim the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
happiness of men is plainly the doctrine of providence; and in
making benevolence an attribute of deity<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the Stoics turn their
backs for ever upon the belief in gods that are greedy, jealous,
mischievous, and haughty; that is, not merely on such deities as
were still a part of the creed of the rustic<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, but also such as had
provided the problems of the whole of Greek tragedy, and given
the opportunity for the stinging attacks of Epicurus on religion<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
In examining these attributes of the gods we have anticipated
the enquiries which belong to the third and fourth categories;
namely as to the disposition and the relativity of the gods.
Incidentally we have obtained an excellent illustration of the
logical importance of definition and the four categories. Definition
implies in advance what is contained in each of the categories,
and each category contains implicitly what is contained in the
other three; but the logical mechanism enables us so to express
the doctrine that it is for ever fixed on the memory. Nor can
we easily imagine that the world will ever forget this conception
of a Supreme God, in his essence a living all-wise Being; in his
attributes immortal, immutable<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, active and benevolent; in his
disposition occupied in contemplating and controlling his great
work the universe, and in his relation to his creatures constantly
concerned for their comfort and happiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoicism and the old mythology.</div>

<p id="section253"><b>253.</b> It must by this time be plain that the whole atmosphere
of Stoic religion was alien to that in which
the gods of the Greek and Roman mythology had
taken root. The nominal absorption of these gods
in the Stoic system has therefore no theoretical importance; it
was a work of political adaptation. The Stoics themselves
doubtless believed that they were restoring the original meaning
of the pantheon, and freeing it from corruptions for which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
poets were responsible. The original meaning was also, in their
judgment, the true meaning. Public opinion was already in
revolt against the old theology, both on scientific and on moral
grounds. The current tales of the gods were both incredible
and revolting<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>; the worship of them too often an attempt to
silence the voice of conscience<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. The Stoics proposed to make
the myths symbols of scientific truths, and the ritual an incentive
to honest living. Their interpretation was in the main physical;
the gods represent respectively the heavenly bodies, the elements,
the plants; the amours of the gods represent the continuous
work of the great creative forces of nature. To a lesser extent
explanations are found in society and in history. These interpretations
are greatly assisted by etymologies, according to the
doctrine of dialectics that wisdom lies hid in words. The whole
process may seem to the modern critic puerile, because the
practical occasion for it has passed away; but there are still to
be found thinkers who hold that by such processes alone it is
possible for human thought to progress without civil society
being disrupted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoic metamorphoses.</div>

<p id="section254"><b>254.</b> According to this system Juppiter becomes the fiery
heaven, the chief of the elements, the source of all
life<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>; Juno is the softer air, into which the fire
enters to become the germinating seed<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. Thus
she is called sister as a fellow-element<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, and wife as an instrument
in the creative process. From a slightly different point of view
Chrysippus interpreted Zeus as God, and Hera as matter; and
their union as the commencement of the Creation, when God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
spread throughout matter the seed Logoi<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. So again Hephaestus
(Vulcan) represents fire; Poseidon (Neptune) is the sea; Dis
(Pluto) and Rhea alike stand for the earth<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. Demeter (Ceres)
again is the corn-land<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, and Persephone (Proserpine) the growing
crop; as such she is lost to her mother and lamented by her for
six months in every year<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. Apollo is the sun, Luna or Diana
the moon<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>; Cronus, son of Earth and Heaven, is Chronos
(χρόνος) or Time, and he is said to devour his children, because
all that is begotten of time is in turn consumed by time<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.
Athene or Minerva is the daughter of Zeus, to whom he has
given birth without a partner, because she is the divine Reason
by which he made the universe<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. Chrysippus wrote at length
on the allegorical interpretation of the three Graces<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>; and the
work of Cornutus entirely consists of expositions of this system.</p>

<p>Other gods are recognised by the Stoics as personifications
of actions or feelings; Eros (Cupid), Aphrodite (Venus) and
Pothos (regret) of feelings; Hope (Ἐλπίς, <i>Spes</i>), Justice (Δίκη,
<i>Iustitia</i>) and Wise Law (Εὐνομία) of actions<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. So in particular
Ares (Mars) stands for war, or the setting of array against
array.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minor deities.</div>

<p id="section255"><b>255.</b> We have already noticed that the gods that are borrowed
from the popular mythology do not possess
the divine attribute of immortality; and in some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
them the attribute of benevolence is not prominent. There was
thus a constant tendency to assign them to an order of nature
of lower rank than the deity. Such an order was already constituted
by the popular belief, adopted by the Stoics, that the
whole universe is full of spirits or daemons, some kindly, others
mischievous. Highest in the former class stand the divine
messengers, who everywhere throughout the universe keep watch
over the affairs of men and bring report thereof to God<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. This
was a widespread belief, most in harmony with the principles of
Persism, but also met with in the Rigveda<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and in the poems
of Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. These watchmen are however not the spies of a
cruel tyrant, but the officers of a benevolent sovereign; we find
them early in Roman literature identified with the stars<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, and
this may account for the special recognition of the twins Castor
and Pollux, as kindly daemons that protect sailors from shipwreck<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.
There are also spirits which are careless, idle, or
mischievous<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>; these the deity may employ as his executioners<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.
A daemon which is solely the embodiment of an evil or mischievous
principle, such as the Druh of Persism or the Satan
of Judaism, is however not to be found in the Stoic system.
Amongst daemons are also to be recognised the souls of men
parted from their bodies, some good and some evil<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. All
beliefs of this kind are specially characteristic of the type of
Stoicism introduced by Posidonius<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. We may specially note
the belief in the Genius which accompanies each man from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
birth to his death, (and which closely corresponds to the guardian
angel of Persism,) because of the special vogue it obtained in
the Roman world<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deified men.</div>

<p id="section256"><b>256.</b> The Stoics never failed to close their list of deities
with the recognition of men raised to the sky for
their services to their fellow-men. Such were
Hercules, who rid the earth of monsters; Castor and Pollux;
Aesculapius the inventor of medicine; Liber the first cultivator
of the vine, and (amongst the Romans) Romulus the founder
of the city. These are deities established by the laws of each
city<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. The Stoics do not raise their own leaders to this
position, but (as we shall see in dealing with the question of
the ‘wise man’) they assign to them almost equal honours.
This part of their theory appears to open the door to great
practical abuses, since it might be used to justify the claims of
the sovereigns of Egypt to be honoured as gods during their
lifetime, and those of the Roman emperors that their predecessors
should be worshipped as such after their death. But it does
not seem that such an abuse actually occurred; and this part of
the theory of gods always seems to have been regarded by the
Stoics rather as an explanation of historical facts than as a principle
of civic submission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worship.</div>

<p id="section257"><b>257.</b> Questions as to the worship of the gods belong strictly
to the department of politics, so far as public worship
is concerned, and of ethics, so far as individuals
are concerned. It may however be convenient to anticipate the
discussion of them, since we cannot properly appreciate the Stoic
views of religion apart from their practical application. We
must therefore notice that Stoicism in its beginnings, in accordance
with its Cynic origin, was revolutionary, unorthodox, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the popular language atheistic. Not only did it follow the
principles of Persism in condemning altogether the worship of
images, but it also poured scorn upon the building of temples
and the offering of sacrifices. Thus Zeno in his book on ‘the
State’ forbids the making of temples and images, because they
are unworthy of the deity<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>; an idea which the Romans recognised
as not altogether strange to their own history, seeing that
for a hundred and seventy years (presumably during the Etruscan
supremacy) no images had been known at Rome<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. The
Stoic condemnation of sacrifice is mostly expressed by silence,
but it finds words in Seneca<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. Although they thus denounced
in principle the whole existing system of public worship, the
Stoics did not feel themselves prevented from taking part in it
as a seemly and ancient custom<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>; and the Roman Stoics took
a special pride in the reputation of the city for attention to
‘religion,’ that is to say, to the ritual observances due to the
gods<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoic hymnology.</div>

<p id="section258"><b>258.</b> Meanwhile the Stoics actively developed their own
ideal of worship, namely the rendering of praise
and honour to the gods by means of hymns. ‘It
is reasonable,’ said Zeno, ‘to honour the gods<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.’ The hymn
of Cleanthes shows the form in which this honour could find
expression, and though in the main it is an outburst of individual
conviction, yet it contains the germ of public hymnology<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. The
value of music in public worship was recognised by Diogenes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
Babylon<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. Posidonius laid it down that the best and most pious
worship of the gods is to honour them with pure mind and
voice<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. Epictetus speaks continually in this spirit, and gives
us examples of prose hymnology: ‘great is God, who has given
us implements with which we shall cultivate the earth<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>’; ‘I
give thee all thanks that thou hast allowed me to join in this
thy assemblage of men, and to see thy works, and to comprehend
this thy administration<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.’ Thus ought we ‘to sing hymns
to the deity, and bless him, and tell of his benefits<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prayer.</div>

<p id="section259"><b>259.</b> Prayer to the gods may be taken as more characteristic
of private and individual worship, though the
paradox is worthy of attention that men should
ask nothing of the gods that they cannot ask publicly<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. The
whole problem of prayer is so fully and admirably treated upon
Stoic lines by Juvenal in his Tenth Satire, that nothing can
be added to his exposition but the evidence that his teaching
is in fact Stoic. Let us then enter the temples and listen to
men’s prayers. First they beg the doorkeeper for admission,
though the deity is equally near to them outside; then they
raise their hands to the sky, or press their mouths close to the
ear of an image<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. To the unlistening deity they pour out
wishes so shameful that they could not let a fellow-man share
their secret<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. Decrepit old men babble prayers for long life,
and make themselves out younger than they are<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. Another
prays for riches<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>, or for some other thing that will do him
harm<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. Undertakers pray for a busy season<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Parents and
nurses (and these are the nearest to innocence) pray for the
success of their children in life<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. They may be excused, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the thoughtful man should know that the advantages for which
friends have prayed have often in the end proved a man’s destruction<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.
He should examine his own heart, and recognise
that his prayers till now have been unworthy and foolish<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.
Since the gods wish us well, let us leave it to them to choose
what is best for us<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. ‘Look up to God, and say:—deal with
me for the future as thou wilt: I am of the same mind as thou
art. I am thine, I refuse nothing that pleases thee<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.’ ‘Seek
not that the things which happen should happen as you wish;
but wish the things that happen to be as they are: and you will
have a tranquil flow of life<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Self-examination.</div>

<p id="section260"><b>260.</b> Prayer so regarded becomes not merely an act of
resignation, in which a man ceases to battle against
a destiny that is too strong for him; it is a daily
examination of his soul, to know whether it is in tune with the
purposes of the universe. This examination is a religious
exercise, never to be omitted before sleep. It is inculcated both
by Seneca and Epictetus. ‘How beautiful’ says Seneca, ‘is this
custom of reviewing the whole day! how quiet a sleep follows
on self-examination! The mind takes its place on the judgment-seat,
investigates its own actions, and awards praise or blame
according as they are deserved<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.’ And Epictetus adopts the
verses ascribed to Pythagoras:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">From first to last examine all, and then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blame what is wrong, in what is right rejoice<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.’</div>

<div class="sidenote">Religious duty.</div>

<p id="section261"><b>261.</b> We are now in a position to sum up in technical
language<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> the obligations of religion freed from
superstition<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. Our duty towards the gods is
rightly to believe in them, to acknowledge their greatness and
benevolence, to submit to them as the creators and rulers of the
universe<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. We may not light lamps in their honour on sabbath-days,
nor crowd round their temples in the early hours of the
morning; we may not offer Jove a towel nor Juno a mirror<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.
Our service to them is to make ourselves like to them; he who
would win their favour, must be a good man<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. Wheresoever
they call us, we must follow with gladness, for they are wiser
than we<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. Without God we must attempt nothing, but we
must always reflect, examine ourselves, and seek to learn the
divine will<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. We came here when it pleased God, and we must
depart when he shall please<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. ‘So live,’ says the Stoic teacher,
‘with your fellow-men, as believing that God sees you: so hold
converse with God, as to be willing that all men should hear
you<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.’</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1138" href="#FNanchor_1138" class="label">[83]</a> Rival philosophers in the earlier times, and the church fathers later, concurred
in reviling Chrysippus because he extended this principle of interpretation to a ‘disgraceful’
representation found in Argos or Samos, in which Hera receives the divine
seed in her mouth; yet Christian antiquity was about to absorb the similar notion of
the conception of the Virgin Mary through the ear (‘quae per aurem concepisti’
in an old Latin hymn). Chrysippus of course rightly estimated the absurdity of
criticising cosmic processes as if they were breaches of social decency, and by so
doing relieved the pious souls of his own day from a real source of distress. See

<span class="smaller">THE KINGDOM OF THE SOUL.</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Man a part of the universe.</div>

<p id="section262"><b>262.</b> From the contemplation of the universe as a whole,
both from the purely scientific standpoint in the
study of physics, and from the more imaginative
point of view in the dogmas of religion, we now
pass on to the more intimate study of the individual man,
consisting of body and soul. In its main outlines the Stoic
theory has already been sketched. Thus it follows from the
monistic standpoint that man is not ultimately an ‘individual’
or unit of the universe; for the universe itself is the only true
unit, and a man is a part of it which cannot even for a moment
break itself off completely from the whole. It is therefore only
in a secondary and subordinate sense, and with special reference
to the inculcation of ethics, that we can treat Zeno or Lucilius
as separate and independent beings. Again, when we say that
man ‘consists of body and soul,’ we are merely adopting popular
language; for body and soul are ultimately one, and differ only
in the gradation of spirit or tone which informs them. Then
we have already learnt in dialectics that the highest power of
man is that of ‘assent’ or free choice, which is displayed in
every exercise of reason; and the same power, though in a
different aspect, is at work in every moral act. The doctrine
of the universe is based upon the postulate that it is a living
rational being on the largest scale; and it follows, that each
man is a ‘microcosm,’ and contains in himself a complete representation
of the universe in miniature. Lastly, we see that man
takes his place in the universe, a little lower than gods and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
daemons, and as greatly higher than animals as these in their
turn surpass plants and inanimate objects; and that his nature,
considered as composite, includes all the varying gradations of
spirit to which these orders correspond within the universe. In
all his parts alike the divine element is immanent and it binds
them together in a coherent unity (συμπάθεια τῶν μέρων). It
remains for us to put together from these and like points of
departure a complete picture of human nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The soul’s kingdom.</div>

<p id="section263"><b>263.</b> To indicate the general trend of Stoic thought on
this subject we propose the title ‘the kingdom of
soul.’ Starting with the popular distinction
between body and soul, we find that the biologist and the
physician alike are preoccupied with the study of the body,
that is, of physiology. Only as an afterthought and supplement
to their work are the functions of soul considered; and
they are treated as far as possible by the methods suggested by
the study of the body. All this is reversed in the Stoic
philosophy. The study of the soul stands in the front, and is
treated by methods directly suggested by observation of the
soul’s functions. The body is not entirely ignored, but is
considered of comparatively small importance. Further, the
soul itself is manifold, and is likened to a State, in which all
is well if the governing part have wisdom and benevolence
proportionate to its power, and if the lower parts are content
to fulfil their respective duties; but if the balance of the State
is upset, all becomes disorder and misery<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Lastly, this kingdom
is itself a part of a greater whole, namely of the Cosmopolis or
universal State. By the comparison with a kingdom we are
also directed towards right moral principle. For as the citizen
of Corinth or Sparta ought not to repine because his city is of
less grandeur than Athens, so no man should be anxious because
his external opportunities are limited. He has a kingdom in
his own mind and soul and heart. Let him be content to find
his happiness in rightly administering it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Man a picture of the universe.</div>

<p id="section264"><b>264.</b> The doctrine that man is a representation or reflection
of the universe is of unknown antiquity. It seems
to be clearly implied by the teaching of Heraclitus,
in so far as he lays it down that both the universe
and man are vivified and controlled by the Logos<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. The
technical terms ‘macrocosm’ (μέγας κόσμος) and ‘microcosm’
(μικρὸς κόσμος), are, as we have seen, employed by Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
But even if we suppose that this conception is a commonplace
of Greek philosophy, it is in Stoicism alone that it is of fundamental
importance, and knit up with the whole framework of
the system. And accordingly we find that all the Stoic masters
laid stress upon this principle. The words of Zeno suggest to
Cicero that ‘the universe displays all impulses of will and all
corresponding actions just like ourselves when we are stirred
through the mind and the senses<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.’ Cleanthes used the dogma
of the soul of the universe to explain the existence of the
human soul as a part of it<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Chrysippus found a foundation
for ethics in the doctrine that man should study and imitate
the universe<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Diogenes of Babylon says boldly that God
penetrates the universe, as soul the man<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; and Seneca that the
relation of God to matter is the same as that of the soul to
the body<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. It is little wonder therefore if by Philo’s time the
analogy had become a commonplace, and philosophers of more
than one school were accustomed to say that ‘man is a little
universe, and the universe a big man<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.’ God is therefore the
soul of the universe<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; on the other hand the soul is God within
the human body<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, a self-moving force encased in relatively inert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
matter, providence at work within the limitations of natural
necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soul and body.</div>

<p id="section265"><b>265.</b> The dualism of body and soul appears in a sharply
defined shape in Persism, and upon it depends the
popular dogma of the immortality of the soul,
which (as we have already noticed) reached the Greco-Roman
world from a Persian source<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. It appears to be rooted in the
more primitive ways of thinking termed ‘Animism’ and ‘Spiritism,’
in which men felt the presence both in natural objects and
within themselves of forces which they conceived as distinct
beings. According to this system a man’s soul often assumes
bodily shape, and quits his body even during life, either in sleep
or during a swoon; sometimes indeed it may be seen to run
away and return in the shape of a mouse or a hare. At death
it is seen to leave the man as a breath of air, and to enter the
atmosphere. But besides his soul a man possesses a shadow,
a likeness, a double, a ghost, a name; and all these in varying
degrees contribute to form what we should call his personality.
In the animistic system the soul survives the man, and why not?
But this survival is vaguely conceived, and only credited so far
as the evidence of the senses supports it. Its formulation in the
doctrine of immortality belongs to a more advanced stage of
human thought<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soul and body are one.</div>

<p id="section266"><b>266.</b> This dualistic conception could be and was incorporated
in the Stoic system to the same extent as
the dualism of God and matter, but no further.
Ultimately, as we have already learnt, soul and
body are one; or, in the language of paradox, ‘soul is body<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.’
This follows not only from the general principles of our philosophy,
but also specifically from observation of the facts of
human life. ‘The incorporeal,’ argued Cleanthes, ‘cannot be
affected by the corporeal, nor the corporeal by the incorporeal,
but only the corporeal by the corporeal. But the soul is affected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
by the body in disease and in mutilation, and the body by the
soul, for it reddens in shame and becomes pale in fear: therefore
the soul is body<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.’ And similarly Chrysippus argues: ‘death
is the separation of soul from body. Now the incorporeal
neither joins with nor is separated from body, but the soul
does both. The soul therefore is body<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.’ This doctrine is
commonly adduced as evidence of the ‘materialism’ of the
Stoics: yet the Stoics do not say that ‘soul is matter,’ and (as
we shall see) they explain its workings upon principles quite
different to the laws of physics or chemistry. The essential
unity of body and soul follows also from the way in which we
acquire knowledge of them. For we perceive body by the
touch; and we learn the workings of the soul by a kind of touch,
called the inward touch (ἐντὸς ἁφή)<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mind, soul and body.</div>

<p id="section267"><b>267.</b> Having realised that the division of man into soul
and body is not ultimate, we may more easily
prepare ourselves to make other divisions. A
division into three parts, (i) body, (ii) soul or life (ψυχή, <i>anima</i>),
and (iii) mind (νοῦς, <i>animus</i>), was widely accepted in Stoic
times, and in particular by the school of Epicurus; the mind
being that which man has, and the animals have not<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. The
Stoics develope this division by the principle of the microcosm.
Mind is that which man has in common with the deity; life
that which he has in common with the animals; growth (φύσις,
<i>natura</i>), that which he has in common with the plants, as for
instance is shown in the hair and nails<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Man also possesses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
cohesion (ἕξις, <i>unitas</i>) but never apart from higher powers.
Further these four, mind, soul, growth, and cohesion, are not
different in kind, but all are spirits (πνεύματα) which by their
varying degrees of tension (τόνος, <i>intentio</i>) are, to a less or
greater extent, removed from the divine being, the primal stuff.
In this sense man is not one, nor two, but multiple, as the deity
is multiple<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The soul is fire and air.</div>

<p id="section268"><b>268.</b> The soul in its substance or stuff is fire, identical with
the creative fire which is the primal stuff of the
universe<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. But the popular conception, according
to which the soul is air or breath, and is seen to
leave the body at death, is also not without truth<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. There is a
very general opinion that the soul is a mixture of fire and air,
or is hot air<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. By this a Stoic would not mean that the soul
was a compound of two different elements, but that it was a
variety of fire in the first stage of the downward path, beginning
to form air by relaxation of its tension: but even so this form
of the doctrine was steadily subordinated to the older doctrine
of Heraclitus, that the soul is identical with the divine fire.
Formally the soul is defined, like the deity himself, as a ‘fiery
intelligent spirit<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>’; and in this definition it would seem that we
have no right to emphasize the connexion between the word
‘spirit’ (πνεῦμα) and its original meaning ‘breath,’ since the word
has in our philosophy many other associations. It is further a
Stoic paradox that ‘the soul is an animal,’ just as God is an
animal. But the soul and the man are not on that account two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
animals; all that is meant is that men and the brutes, by reason
of their being endowed with soul, become animals<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The temperaments.</div>

<p id="section269"><b>269.</b> According to another theory, which is probably not
specifically Stoic, but derived from the Greek
physicians, the soul is compounded of all four
elements in varying proportion, and the character of each soul
(subject, in the Stoic theory, to the supreme control of reason<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>)
is determined by the proportion or ‘temperament’ (κρᾶσις,
<i>temperatura</i>) of the four elements. There are accordingly four
temperaments, the fervid, the frigid, the dry, and the moist,
according to the preponderance of fire, air, earth, and water
respectively<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Dull and sleepy natures are those in which there
is an excess of the gross elements of earth and water<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; whilst
an excess of cold air makes a man timorous, and an excess of
fire makes him passionate<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. These characters are impressed
upon a man from birth and by his bodily conditions, and within
the limits indicated above are unalterable<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. The ‘temperaments’
have always been a favourite subject of discussion in popular
philosophy<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The soul’s parts.</div>

<p id="section270"><b>270.</b> The characteristic attribute of the soul is that it is
self-moved (αὐτοκίνητον)<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. Although in this point
the Stoics agree with Plato, they do not go on to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
name life as another attribute, for they do not agree with the
argument of the <i>Phaedo</i> that the soul, having life as an inseparable
attribute, is incapable of mortality. We pass on to
the dispositions of the soul, which correspond to its ‘parts’ in
other philosophies, and are indeed often called its parts. But
the soul has not in the strict sense parts<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; what are so called
are its activities<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, which are usually reckoned as eight in
number, though the precise reckoning is of no importance<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.
The eight parts of the soul are the ruling part or ‘principate<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,’
the five senses, and the powers of speech and generation. The
seven parts or powers other than the principate are subject to it
and do its bidding, so that the soul is, as we have called it, a
kingdom in itself. These seven parts are associated each with a
separate bodily organ, but at the same time each is connected
with the principate. They may therefore be identified with
‘spirits which extend from the principate to the organs, like the
arms of an octopus<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>,’ where by a ‘spirit’ we mean a pulsation
or thrill, implying incessant motion and tension. The principate
itself, that is the mind, is also a spirit possessed of a still higher
tension; and the general agreement of the Stoics places its
throne conveniently at the heart and in the centre of the body<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
Accordingly Posidonius defined the soul’s parts as ‘powers of
one substance seated at the heart<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aspects of the principate.</div>

<p id="section271"><b>271.</b> If we now fix our attention on the principate itself,
we find it no more simple than the universe, the
deity, the man, or the soul. In particular it
resembles the deity in that, although essentially
one, it is called by many names. It is the soul in its reasoning
aspect, the reason, the intellect (λογικὴ ψυχή, νοῦς, διάνοια)<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>;
it is also the ‘ego,’ that is, the will, the energy, the capacity for
action<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. It is in one aspect the divinity in us, world-wide,
universal; in another the individual man with his special bent
and character; so that we may even be said to have two souls
in us, the world-soul and each man’s particular soul<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. The
principate becomes also in turn each of the other functions or
parts of the soul, for each of them is an aspect of the principate
(ἡγεμονικόν πως ἔχον)<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. In addition the principate has many
titles of honour, as when Marcus Aurelius terms it the Pilot<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,
the King and Lawgiver<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, the Controller and Governor<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, the
God within<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The principate as reason.</div>

<p id="section272"><b>272.</b> Although for the purpose of discussion we may distinguish
between reason and will, they are in fact
everywhere intermingled. Thus the principate as
the reasoning part of the soul includes the powers
of perception, assent, comprehension, and of reason in the
narrower sense, that is, the power of combining the various
conceptions of the mind, so as ultimately to form a consistent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
system<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. But amongst these powers assent is equally an act
of the will; and on the other hand the judgments formed by
the reasoning mind are not purely speculative, but lead up to
action; so that it is the reasoning power which must be kept
pure, in order that it may duly control the soul’s inclinations
and aversions, its aims and shrinkings, its plans, interests and
assents<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. If in the Stoic theory the greater emphasis always
appears to be laid on the reason, it is the more necessary in
interpreting it to bear in mind that we are speaking of the
reason of an active and social being.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The principate as will.</div>

<p id="section273"><b>273.</b> The maintenance of the principate as will in a right
condition is the problem of ethics; and it is
important to understand what this right condition
is. The answer is to be found in a series of
analogies, drawn from all departments of philosophy. Thus
from the standpoint of physics the right condition is a proper
strain or tension, as opposed to slackness or unsteadiness<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. In
theology it is the agreement of the particular will with the
divine or universal will<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. From the point of view of the will
itself it is the strength and force (ἰσχὺς καὶ κράτος) of the will,
the attitude that makes a man say ‘I can<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.’ Again it is that
state of the soul which corresponds to health in the body<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>;
and in a quiet mood the Stoic may describe it as a restful and
calm condition<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Finally, if the soul as a whole is compared
to a State, the principate in its function as the will may at
its best be compared to a just and kind sovereign; but if this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
aim is missed, it may turn into a greedy and ungovernable
tyrant<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The principate, divine and human.</div>

<p id="section274"><b>274.</b> The principate, as it is of divine origin<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, and destined,
as we shall see, to be re-absorbed in the deity, may
rightly be called god: it is a god making its
settlement and home in a human body<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>: it keeps
watch within over the moral principle<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. In the
language of paradox we may say to each man, ‘You are a
god<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.’ Of this principle we see the proof in that man interests
himself in things divine<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>, and in it we find the first incentive
to a lofty morality<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. As however the deity is not conceived
in human form, and is not subject to human weaknesses, there
comes a point at which, in the study of the human principate,
we part company with the divine; and this point we reach both
when we consider the principate with regard to its seven
distinctly human manifestations, and when we consider its
possible degradation from the standard of health and virtue.
We now turn to the seven parts or powers of the human soul
which are subordinate to the reasoning faculty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Powers of the principate.</div>

<p id="section275"><b>275.</b> The first five powers of the principate are those which
are recognised in popular philosophy as the ‘five
senses.’ To materialistic philosophers nothing is
plainer than that these are functions of the body;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
is it not the eye which sees, and the ear which hears<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>? This
the Stoic denies. The eye does not see, but the soul sees
through the eye as through an open door. The ear does not
hear, but the soul hears through the ear. Sensation therefore is
an activity of the principate, acting in the manner already
described in the chapter on ‘Reason and Speech<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.’ The soul
is actively engaged, and sends forth its powers as water from a
fountain; the sense-organs are passively affected by the objects
perceived<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Subject to this general principle, sensation (αἴσθησις,
<i>sensus</i>) may be variously defined. It is ‘a spirit which penetrates
from the principate to the sensory processes’; it includes
alike the mind-picture (φαντασία, <i>visum</i>), that is, the first rough
sketch which the mind shapes when stimulated by the sense-organ;
the assent (συγκατάθεσις, <i>adsensus</i>), which the mind
gives or refuses to this sketch; and the final act of comprehension
(κατάληψις, <i>comprehensio</i>) by which this assent is sealed
or ratified<a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. Of these the middle stage is the most important,
so that we may say paradoxically ‘sense is assent<a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.’ Only in
a secondary and popular way can we use the word sensation
to denote the physical apparatus of the sensory organs
(αἰσθητήρια), as when we say of a blind man ‘he has lost the
sense of sight<a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The five senses.</div>

<p id="section276"><b>276.</b> The nature of sensation is more particularly described
in the case of sight and hearing. In the first case
there proceed from the eyes rays, which cause
tension in the air, reaching towards the object seen<a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
tension is cone-shaped, and as the distance from the pupil of
the eye increases, the base of the cone is increased in size,
whilst the vigour of the sight diminishes. This human activity
effects vision of itself in one case; for we say ‘darkness is
visible,’ when the eye shoots forth light at it, and correctly
recognises that it is darkness<a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. But in complete vision there is
an opposing wave-motion coming from the object, and the two
waves become mutually absorbed: hence Posidonius called
sight ‘absorption’ (σύμφυσις)<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. Similarly, in the case of
hearing, the pulsation (which, as we have seen, comes in the
first instance from the principate) spreads from the ear to the
speaker, and (as is now more distinctly specified) from the
speaker to the hearer; this reverse pulsation being circular in
shape, like the waves excited on the surface of a lake by
throwing a stone into the water<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Of the sensations of smell,
taste and touch we only hear that they are respectively (i) a
spirit extending from the principate to the nostrils, (ii) a spirit
extending from the principate to the tongue, and (iii) a spirit
extending to the surface of the body and resulting in the easily-appreciated
touch of an object<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other activities.</div>

<p id="section277"><b>277.</b> The Stoic account of the functions of the soul displayed
in the ordinary activities of life is either
defective or mutilated; for even a slight outline of
the subject should surely include at least breathing, eating (with
drinking), speech, walking, and lifting. We need not however
doubt that these, equally with the five senses, are all ‘spirits
stretching from the principate’ to the bodily organs. This is
expressly stated of walking<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Of all such activities we must
consider voice to be typical, when it is described as the sixth
function of the soul. Voice is described as ‘pulsating air<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>,’ set
in motion by the tongue<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>; but we can trace it back through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
throat to some source below, which we can without difficulty
identify with the heart, the seat of the principate<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. The
voice is indeed in a special relationship to the principate,
since the spoken word is but another aspect of the thought
which is expressed by it<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Procreation.</div>

<p id="section278"><b>278.</b> The seventh and last of the subordinate powers of the
soul, according to the Stoics, is that of procreation.
This part of their system is of great importance,
not only for the study of human nature, but even in a higher
degree for its indirect bearing upon the question of the
development of the universe through ‘procreative principles’
(σπερματικοὶ λόγοι), or, as we have termed them above, ‘seed
powers<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.’ That all things grow after their kind is of course
matter of common knowledge; no combination of circumstances,
no scientific arrangement of sustenance can make of an acorn
anything but an oak, or of a hen’s egg anything but a chicken.
But in the common view this is, at least primarily, a corporeal
or material process; whereas the Stoics assert that it is not only
a property of the soul, but one so primary and fundamental that
it must be also assumed as a first principle of physical science.
Before approaching the subject from the Stoic standpoint, it
may be well to see how far materialistic theories, ancient and
modern, can carry us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Heredity.</div>

<p id="section279"><b>279.</b> Lucretius finds this a very simple matter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Children often resemble not only their parents, but also their grandparents
and more remote ancestors. The explanation is that
the parents contain in their bodies a large number of atoms,
which they have received from their ancestors and pass on to their descendants.
In the chance clashing of atoms in procreation Venus produces all kinds of
effects, bringing about resemblances between children and their forebears, not
only in the face and person, but also in the look, the voice, and the hair<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>This account has a generally plausible sound until we bear
in mind that it is the fundamental property of atoms that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
though their own variety is limited, they can form things in
infinite variety by changes in their combination and arrangement.
They are like the letters out of which words, sentences,
and poems are made up; and we can hardly expect to reproduce
the voice or the spirit of an Aeschylus by a fresh
shuffling of the letters contained in the <i>Agamemnon</i>. On the
contrary, seeing that the atoms contained in the bodies of
parents have largely been drawn from plants and animals, we
could confidently reckon upon finding the complete fauna and
flora of the neighbourhood amongst their offspring. Lucretius
in effect postulates in his theory that particular atoms have a
representative and creative character, passing from father to
child in inseparable association with the marks of the human
race, and endowed with a special capacity of combining with
other like atoms to form the substratum of specifically human
features. In giving his atoms these properties he is insensibly
approximating to the Stoic standpoint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Modern theories.</div>

<p id="section280"><b>280.</b> Modern biologists deal with this subject with the
minuteness of detail of which the microscope is the
instrument, and with the wealth of illustration
which results from the incessant accumulation of ascertained
facts. But they are perhaps open to the criticism that where
they reach the borders of their own science, they are apt to
introduce references to the sciences of chemistry and physics as
explaining all difficulties, even in regions to which these sciences
do not apply. The following account is taken from one of the
most eminent of them:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Hertwig discovered that the one essential occurrence in impregnation
is the coalescence of the two sexual cells and their nuclei. Of the millions
of male spermatozoa which swarm round a female egg-cell, only one forces
its way into its plasmic substance. The nuclei of the two cells are drawn
together by a mysterious force which we conceive as a <i>chemical sense-activity
akin to smell</i>, approach each other and melt into one. So there arises through
the sensitiveness of the two sexual nuclei, <i>as a result of erotic chemotropism</i>,
a new cell which unites the inherited capacities of both parents; the spermatozoon
contributes the paternal, the egg-cell the maternal characteristics to
the primary-cell, from which the child is developed<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>In another passage the same author sums up his results
in bold language from which all qualifications and admissions
of imperfect knowledge have disappeared:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Physiology has proved that all <i>the phenomena of life may be reduced to
chemical and physical processes</i>. The cell-theory has shown us that all the
complicated phenomena of the life of the higher plants and animals may be
deduced from the simple physico-chemical processes in the elementary
organism of the microscopic cells, and the material basis of them is the
plasma of the cell-body<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Their inadequacy.</div>

<p id="section281"><b>281.</b> These utterances may be considered typical of modern
materialistic philosophy in its extreme form. We
may nevertheless infer from the references to a
‘mysterious force,’ ‘chemical sense-activity akin to smell,’ and
‘erotic chemotropism,’ that the analogies to biological facts
which the writer finds in chemical science stand in need of further
elucidation. We may notice further that the ‘atom’ has entirely
disappeared from the discussion, and that the ‘material basis’
of the facts is a ‘plasma’ or ‘plasmic substance,’ something in
fact which stands related to a ‘protoplasm’ of which the chemical
and physical sciences know nothing, but which distinctly resembles
the ‘fiery creative body’ which is the foundation of the
Stoic physics. Further we must notice that the old problem of
‘the one and the many’ reappears in this modern description;
for the cell and its nucleus are neither exactly one nor exactly
two, but something which passes from two to one and from one
to two; further the nuclei of the two cells, being drawn
together, coalesce, and from their union is developed a ‘new cell’
which unites the capacities of its ‘parents.’ Modern science,
therefore, although it has apparently simplified the history of
generation by reducing it to the combination of two units out
of many millions that are incessantly being produced by parent
organisms, has left the philosophical problem of the manner of
their combination entirely unchanged. In these microscopic
cells is latent the whole physical and spiritual inheritance of the
parents, whether men, animals or plants, from which they are
derived; just as the atoms of Epicurus possess the germ of free<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
will<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, so the cells of Haeckel smell and love, struggle for
marriage union, melt away in each other’s embrace, and lose
their own individuality at the moment that a new being enters
the universe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation and procreation.</div>

<p id="section282"><b>282.</b> If then the phenomena of reproduction are essentially
the same, whether we consider the relations of two
human beings or those of infinitesimal elements
which seem to belong to another order of being,
we are already prepared for the Stoic principle that the creation
of the universe is repeated in miniature in the bringing into life
of each individual amongst the millions of millions of organic
beings which people it. From this standpoint we gain fresh
light upon the Stoic theory of creation, and particularly of the
relation of the eternal Logos to the infinite multitude of procreative
principles or ‘seed-powers.’ Again, it is with the
general theory of creation in our minds that we must revert to
the Stoic explanation of ordinary generation. This is to him
no humble or unclean function of the members of the body; it
is the whole man, in his divine and human nature, that is
concerned<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. The ‘procreative principle’ in each man is a part
of his soul<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>; ‘the seed is a spirit’ (or pulsation) ‘extending from
the principate to the parts of generation<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.’ It is an emanation
from the individual in which one becomes two, and two become
one. Just as the human soul is a ‘fragment’ of the divine, so is
the seed a fragment torn away, as it were, from the souls of
parents and ancestors<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.</p>

is derived from one or both parents, and if the latter, whether
in equal proportion. The Stoics do not appear to have kept
entirely free from the common prepossession, embodied in the
law of paternal descent, according to which the male element
is alone active in the development of the organism; and so they
allege that the female seed is lacking in tone and generative
power<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. On the other hand observation appeared to them to
show that children inherit the psychical and bodily qualities of
both parents, and the general tendency of their philosophy was
towards the equalization of the sexes. On the whole the latter
considerations prevailed, so that the doctrine of Stoicism, as of
modern times, was that qualities, both of body and soul, are
inherited from the seed of both parents<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>; wherein the possibility
remains open, that in particular cases the debt to one parent
may be greater than to the other<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impulses.</div>

<p id="section284"><b>284.</b> The Stoic psychology is in its fundamental principles
wholly distinct from that of Plato; which does not
at all prevent its exponents, and least of all those
like Panaetius and Posidonius who were admirers of Plato, from
making use of his system as an auxiliary to their own. Plato
divided the soul into three parts; the rational part, the emotional
(and volitional) part, and the appetitive<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. Both the two latter
parts need the control of the reason, but the emotional part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
inclines to virtue, the appetitive to vice<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. The rational part,
as with the Stoics, is peculiar to man; the other two are also
possessed by the animals, and the appetitive soul even by plants.
The Stoics do not however seriously allow any kinship between
virtue and the emotions, and they deal with this part of the
subject as follows. Nature has implanted in all living things
certain impulses which are directed towards some object. An
impulse towards an object is called ‘appetite’ (ὁρμή, <i>appetitus</i> or
<i>impetus</i>); an impulse to avoid an object is called ‘aversion’
(ἀφορμή, <i>alienatio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. In man appetite should be governed by
reason; if this is so, it becomes ‘reasonable desire’ (ὄρεξις
εὔλογος, <i>recta appetitio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>; if otherwise, it becomes ‘unreasonable
desire’ (ὄρεξις ἀπειθὴς λόγῳ) or ‘concupiscence’ (ἐπιθυμία,
<i>libido</i>). To living things lower in the scale than man terms that
are related to reason can of course not apply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Will and responsibility.</div>

<p id="section285"><b>285.</b> Practical choice is, according to the Stoics, exactly
analogous to intellectual decision. Just as the
powers of sensation never deceive us<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, so also the
impulses are never in themselves irrational<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. An impulse is
an adumbration of a course of action as proper to be pursued<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>;
to this the will gives or refuses its assent<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. It is the will, and
the will only, which is liable to error, and this through want of
proper tone and self-control. If there is this want, it appears in
a false judgment, a weak assent, an exaggerated impulse; and
this is what we call in ethics a perturbation<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. A healthy assent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
leads up to a right action: a false assent to a blunder or sin.
Hence we hold to the Socratic paradox that ‘no one sins
willingly’ (οὐδεὶς ἑκὼν ἁμαρτάνει); for the true and natural will
cannot sin; it must first be warped to a false judgment and
weakened by slackness of tone. We can equally use the paradox
that ‘every voluntary action is a judgment of the intellect,’ or
(in few words) that ‘virtue is wisdom’ (φρόνησις ἡ ἀρετή). In
such views we find a starting-point for dealing with the problems
of ethics, including those of the ethical ideal or supreme good,
its application to daily duties, and its failure through ignorance
or weakness of soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The body.</div>

<p id="section286"><b>286.</b> We pass on to consider the body, but at no great
length; partly because many functions often considered
as bodily are by the Stoics treated as
belonging to the soul (as sensations and impulses), partly
because the study of the body is rather the task of the physician
than of the philosopher. In the body we may notice separately
(i) the bones, sinews, and joints, constituting the framework on
which the whole is built up; (ii) the surface, including beauty
of outline and features, and (iii) the complexion, which suffuses
a glow over the surface and most attracts the attention<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. No
absolute distinction can be made between body and soul.
Generally speaking, we may say that body is composed of the two
grosser elements, earth and water, whilst soul (as we have seen)
rests on the two higher elements of air and fire<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>; of the gradations
of spirit body possesses distinctively (but not exclusively)
that of coherence (ἕξις), whilst it shares with the soul the principle
of growth (φύσις)<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. Yet these contrasts are after all only
secondary. As surely as soul is body so body is soul, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
divinity penetrates into its humblest parts. In its practical
applications Stoicism dwells so little on the body that the wise
man seems hardly conscious of its existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘The flesh.’</div>

<p id="section287"><b>287.</b> Side by side with the strictly Stoic view of the body
we find in all the Roman literature another conception
which is strongly dualistic, and which we
cannot but think to be drawn from some non-Stoic source<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.
According to this view the body, often called the ‘flesh,’ is
essentially evil<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>; it is the prison-house of the soul<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, the source
of corruption of the will<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, the hindrance to a clear insight of
the intelligence. In the language picturesquely adopted in the
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> (after St Paul), it is a burden which the
enlightened man longs to shake off<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. For the body so understood
we find abusive names; it is the husk in which the grain
is concealed<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, the ass from which the owner should be ready
to part at any moment<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. This language tends to be exaggerated
and morbid, and leads in practice to asceticism<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. It
appealed in ancient as in modern times to a widespread sentiment,
but is not reconcileable with the main teaching of the
Stoic philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dignity of the body.</div>

<p id="section288"><b>288.</b> According to the true Stoic view, the body is a
dwelling-place or temple inhabited for a time by
the principate, its divinity<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. Therefore the body
as such is deserving of respect, even of veneration<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.
In particular the erect form of the human body is a mark of
divine favour, by which it is hinted that man is fitted to contemplate
the operations of the heavens<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. The whole framework
of the body, from the organs of sensation to those by which we
breathe, swallow, and digest, is a masterpiece of divine skill,
and an evidence of the care of providence for man<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. And even
as an architect provides that those parts of the house which are
offensive to sight and smell should be out of sight, so has
nature hidden away those parts of the body which are necessarily
offensive, at a distance from the organs of sense<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. The
Stoic conception of the dignity of the body is symbolized in
practical ethics by the culture of the beard, in which is latent
the broad principle of attention to the cleanliness and healthy
development of every part of the body.</p>

<p>It is a mark of the Oriental associations of Stoicism that this
respect for the body is never associated with the Hellenic cult
of the body as displayed in art and gymnastics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Junction of soul and body.</div>

<p id="section289"><b>289.</b> Having now studied man in all his parts, it is time
to consider how those parts are compacted together,
how man grows and decays, and what varieties of
mankind exist. First then the principate is combined
with the lower functions of the soul, and every part of
the soul, by the process of interpenetration (σῶμα διὰ σώματος<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
χωρεῖ)<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>; or (from a slightly different point of view) upon body
which has cohesion (ἕξις) is overlaid growth, on growth soul,
and on soul reason; so that the higher tension presupposes the
lower, but not <i>vice versa</i>. In the act of generation the soul
loses its higher tensions; and consequently the embryo
possesses neither human nor animal soul, but only the
principles of cohesion and growth. It is in fact a vegetable<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>,
but necessarily differs from other vegetables in having the
potentiality of rising to a higher grade of spirit<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. At the
moment of birth its growth-power (φύσις) is brought into
contact with the cold air, and through this chill it rises to the
grade of animal life, and becomes soul (ψυχή from ψῦξις)<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.
This etymological theory provokes the ridicule of opponents,
who do not fail to point out that soul, standing nearer to the
divine fire than growth, ought to be produced by warmth
rather than by coolness; but the Stoics probably had in mind
that contact with either of the two higher elements must raise
the gradation of spirit. The infant, according to this theory,
is an animal, but not yet a man; it has not the gift of reason<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.
To attain this higher stage there is need both of growth from
within, and of association with reasonable beings without; in
these ways reason may be developed in or about the seventh
year<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. In the whole of its growth the soul needs continually
to be refreshed by the inbreathing of air, and to be sustained
by exhalations from the blood<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. Here we touch upon one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
of those fundamental doctrines of the system, derived by Zeno
from Heraclitus<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>, which bind together the great and the little
world. Just as the heavenly bodies are maintained by exhalations
from the Ocean<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>, so the soul is dependent upon the body
for its daily food. Hence follows the important consequence
that weakness and disease of the body react upon the soul;
the philosopher must keep his body in health for the soul’s good,
if for no other reason<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. If the Stoics in discussing problems
of ethics constantly maintain that the health of the soul is
independent of that of the body, such statements are paradoxical
and need qualification<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sleep and death.</div>

<p id="section290"><b>290.</b> The mutual action of body and soul is most readily
illustrated by sleep. The Stoics do not hold, as
the Animists do, that the soul quits the body in
sleep; nor do they agree with another popular view, that the
soul then quits the extremities of the body and concentrates
itself at the heart<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. Sleep is due to a relaxation, contraction,
or weakening of the spirit<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>; a lowering of its grade, which
nevertheless is clearly no sign of ill health. In old age there is
often an imperfection of the reason, and this is also seen in
the sick, the tired, and the anaemic<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. In death there is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
complete relaxation of tone in the breath that we can feel, that
is, in such spirit as belongs to the body<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>; there follows the
separation of soul from body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The beyond.</div>

<p id="section291"><b>291.</b> We are thus brought to the critically important question
of the existence of the soul after death. On
this point we shall not expect to find that all Stoic
teachers agree in their language. In Zeno himself we shall be
sure to find that variety of suggestion which is accounted for by
his eagerness to learn from all sources; and later writers will
also differ according to their respective inclinations either to
draw strictly logical conclusions from the Stoic physics, or to
respect the common opinion of mankind and to draw from it
conclusions which may be a support to morality<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. These
variations need not discourage us from the attempt to trace in
general outline the common teaching of the school. We have
already seen that the various parts of the Stoic system are
not bound together by strictly logical processes; where two
conclusions appear contradictory, and yet both recommend
themselves to the judgment, the Stoics are not prepared to
sacrifice either the one or the other, but always seek to lessen,
if they cannot altogether remove, the difficulties which stand in
the way of accepting both. On the other hand, we need not
too readily admit the charge of insincerity, whether it is found
in the candid admission of its temptations by Stoic teachers<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>,
or in the less sympathetic criticisms of ancient or modern
exponents of the system<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoic standpoint.</div>

<p id="section292"><b>292.</b> On certain points all Stoic teachers seem to be agreed;
first that the soul is, as regards its substance,
imperishable; secondly, that the individual soul
cannot survive the general conflagration<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>; lastly, that it does
not of necessity perish with the body<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. The first two dogmas
follow immediately from the fundamental principles of the Stoic
physics, and point out that every soul will find its last home by
being absorbed in the divine being. The third dogma leaves
play for ethical principles; subject to the monistic principle of
an ultimate reconciliation, there is room for some sharp distinction
between the destiny of good and bad souls, such as
stands out in the Persian doctrine of rewards and punishments
after death. And so we find it generally held that the souls
of the good survive till the conflagration, whilst those of the
wicked have but a short separate existence, and those of the
lower and non-rational animals perish with their bodies<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. If
this difference in duration will satisfy the moral sense, the nature
of the further existence of the soul may be determined on
physical principles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The released soul.</div>

<p id="section293"><b>293.</b> In the living man the soul, as we have already seen
reason to suppose, derives its cohesion (ἕξις) and
shape from its association with the body. Separated
from the body, it must assume a new shape, and what should
that be but the perfect shape of a sphere<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>? Again, the soul
being compounded of the elements of air and fire must by its
own nature, when freed from the body, pierce through this
murky atmosphere, and rise to a brighter region above, let us
say to that sphere which is just below the moon<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. Here then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
souls dwell like the stars, finding like them their food in exhalations
from the earth<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. Here they take rank as daemons or
heroes (of such the air is full), and as such are joined in the
fulfilment of the purposes of divine providence<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. Yet it must
be admitted that this bright destiny, if substantiated by the laws
of physics, is also subject to physical difficulties. Suppose for
instance that a man is crushed by the fall of a heavy rock; his
soul will not be able to escape in any direction, but will be at
once squeezed out of existence<a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. To fancies of this kind,
whether attractive or grotesque, we shall not be inclined to
pay serious attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tartarus.</div>

<p id="section294"><b>294.</b> In this general theory hope is perhaps held out before
the eyes of good souls, but there is little to terrify
the wicked, even if it be supposed that their souls
neither survive so long, nor soar so high, as those of the good<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.
As against it we are told by a Church Father that Zeno
accepted the Persian doctrine of future rewards and punishments,
and with it the primitive belief in an Inferno in its
crudest form<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. We must agree with the first English editor
of the fragments of Zeno that ‘it is hardly credible that Zeno
can have attached any philosophical importance to a theory stated
in these terms<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>’; they can at the best only have occurred in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
some narration in the style of the Platonic myths, intended to
illustrate a principle but not to convey a literal truth<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. For
just as the whole Hellenistic world, including the Stoics, stood
aloof from the Persian doctrine of a spirit of evil, so it firmly
rejected the dogma of a hell. Lucretius makes it a principal
argument in favour of the philosophy of Epicurus that it drives
out of men’s hearts the fear of Tartarus<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>; but writers partly or
wholly Stoic are not less emphatic. ‘Ignorance of philosophy,’
says Cicero, ‘has produced the belief in hell and its terrors<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.’
In the mouth of the representative of Stoicism he places the
words ‘Where can we find any old woman so silly as to
believe the old stories of the horrors of the world below?<a id="FNanchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>’
‘Those tales’ says Seneca ‘which make the world below
terrible to us, are poetic fictions. There is no black darkness
awaiting the dead, no prison-house, no lake of fire or river
of forgetfulness, no judgment-seat, no renewal of the rule of
tyrants<a id="FNanchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.’</p>

<p>Although we cannot accept Virgil as a scientific exponent
of Stoic teaching, yet there is much reason to suppose that he
is here setting forth a belief which met with very general
acceptance in our school, and of which the principle is that the
sufferings of the disembodied are not a punishment for past
offences, but the necessary means for the purification of the
soul from a taint due to its long contact with the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Probable Stoic origin.</div>

<p id="section296"><b>296.</b> The language in which Virgil first describes the
creation and life of the universe closely resembles
that of Stoicism; the phrases ‘elemental seed,’
‘fiery force,’ ‘heavenly being’ might be used by any Stoic
teacher. The conception of the body as a ‘prison-house,’ even
though it does not express the most scientific aspect of Stoic
physics, was nevertheless, as we have seen, familiar to Stoics
of the later centuries. The ethical conception, again, of the
doctrine of purgatory is exactly that of which the Stoics felt a
need in order to reconcile the dualism of good and evil souls
with the ultimate prevalence of the divine will. Again, we can
have no difficulty in supposing that Virgil drew his material
from Stoic sources, seeing that he was characteristically a learned
poet, and reflects Stoic sentiment in many other passages of his
works<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. We have also more direct evidence. The Church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Father whom we have already quoted not only ascribes to the
Stoics in another passage the doctrine of purgatory, but
expressly quotes this passage from Virgil as an exposition of
Stoic teaching. And here he is supported to some extent by
Tertullian, who says that the Stoics held that the souls of the
foolish after death receive instruction from the souls of the
good<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. Finally, we have the doctrine definitely accepted by

<p id="section297"><b>297.</b> We may now consider more particularly the views
and feelings of individual Stoic teachers. It appears
to us accordingly that Zeno left his followers room
for considerable diversity of opinion, and quoted the Persian
doctrine because of its suggestiveness rather than for its literal
truth. Of Cleanthes we are told that he held that all souls
survived till the conflagration, whilst Chrysippus believed
this only of the souls of the wise<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. Panaetius, although a
great admirer of Plato, is nevertheless so strongly impressed
by the scientific principle that ‘all which is born must die,’
that he is here again inclined to break away from Stoicism,
and to suspend his judgment altogether as to the future
existence of the soul<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>; the belief in a limited future existence
was meaningless to a philosopher who disbelieved in the conflagration.
Of the views of Posidonius we have the definite
hint, that he taught that the ‘air is full of immortal souls<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>’;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
and this is in such harmony with the devout temper of this
teacher that we may readily believe that he enriched the
somewhat bare speculations of his predecessors by the help
of an Oriental imagination, and that he introduced into Stoicism
not only the doctrine of daemons but also that of purgatory,
holding that souls were both pre-existent and post-existent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">View of Seneca.</div>

<p id="section298"><b>298.</b> In the period of the Roman principate the question
of the future existence of the soul acquires special
prominence. Seneca is criticized on the ground that
he affects at times a belief which he does not sincerely entertain,
partly in order to make his teaching more popular, partly to
console his friends in times of mourning. The facts stand
otherwise. At no time does Seneca exceed the limits of the
accepted Stoic creed; he bids his friends look forward to the
period of purgation<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>, the life of pure souls in the regions of the
aether, and the final union with the divine being. It is after
purgation that the soul by the refinement of the elements of
which it is built forces its way to higher regions<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>; it finds a
quiet and peaceful home in the clear bright aether<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>; it has cast
off the burden of the flesh<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>; it is parted by no mountains or
seas from other happy souls<a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>; it daily enjoys free converse
with the great ones of the past<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>; it gazes on the human world
below, and on the sublime company of the stars in its own
neighbourhood<a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. At a later epoch all blessed souls will be
re-absorbed in the primal elements<a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, suffering change but not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
forfeiting their immortal nature<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. The somewhat exuberant
language of Seneca has frequently been adopted by Christian
writers, to express a belief which is not necessarily identical<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>;
but for the associations thus created Seneca must not be held
responsible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personality cannot survive.</div>

<p id="section299"><b>299.</b> With the decay of interest in the Stoic physics there
begins a tendency to overlook the intermediate
stage of the soul’s life, and to dwell solely on its
final absorption; whilst at the same time it is
urged from the ethical standpoint that no possible opinion as to
the soul’s future should disturb the calm of the virtuous mind.
On one further, but important, point the Stoic teaching becomes
clearer. In no case is the soul that survives death to be
identified with the man that once lived. Cut off from all human
relations, from the body and its organs, and from its own subordinate
powers<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, it is no longer ‘you,’ but is something else
that takes your place in the due order of the universe. In all
this the Stoic doctrine remains formally unchanged; but its
expression is now so chastened that it seems only to give a
negative reply to the inherited hope, and the chief comfort it
offers is that ‘death is the end of all troubles.’ This change of
tone begins in Seneca himself; it is he who says to the mourner
‘your loved one has entered upon a great and never-ending
rest<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>’; ‘death is release from all pain and its end<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>’; ‘death is
not to be. I know all its meaning. As things were before
I was born, so they will be after I am gone<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.’ ‘If we perish
in death, nothing remains<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.’ In Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius
this new tone rings out much more clearly; if we like so to
speak, more unrelentingly. To the characteristic passages from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
these writers which are quoted above<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> may be added the
following, perhaps the most precise of all:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘If souls survive death, how can the air hold them from all eternity?
How, we reply, does earth hold the bodies of generation after generation
committed to the grave? Just as on earth, after a certain term of survival,
change and dissolution of substance makes room for other dead bodies, so
too the souls transmuted into air, after a period of survival, change by
processes of diffusion and of ignition, and are resumed into the seminal
principle of the universe, and in this way make room for others to take
up their habitation in their stead. Such is the natural answer, assuming the
survival of souls<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Such are the last words of Stoicism, not wholly satisfying
either to knowledge or to aspiration, but assuredly based on a
wide outlook and a keen discrimination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Men and women.</div>

<p id="section300"><b>300.</b> The whole nature of man, as discussed up to this
point, is common to every individual born into the
world, with some exceptions dependent on age or
temperament which have been explained incidentally. It
remains to discuss shortly the important differences which result
from sex, nationality, and location. There seems every reason
to believe that the equality of men and women, though at the
time seemingly paradoxical, was generally accepted by the
earlier Stoics, and adopted as a practical principle in Stoic
homes. The whole treatment of human nature by the Stoics
applies equally to man and woman, and points to the conclusion
that as moral agents they have the same capacities and the
same responsibilities<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. Seneca in writing to a great lady of
philosophical sympathies states this as his firm conviction<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>, and
the lives of many Stoic wives and daughters (to whom we shall
refer in a later chapter)<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> showed it to have a firm basis in fact.
We need attach no great importance to those more distinctively
masculine views which Seneca occasionally expresses, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
effect that woman is hot-tempered, thoughtless, and lacking in
self-control<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>, or to the Peripatetic doctrine that man is born
to rule, women to obey<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>; for these sentiments, however
welcome to his individual correspondents, were not rooted in
Stoic theory nor exemplified in the Roman society of his
own days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Class and race.</div>

<p id="section301"><b>301.</b> It follows with equal certainty from the early history
of Stoicism, and in particular from the doctrine of
the Cosmopolis, that differences of class and race
were hardly perceived by its founders. For this there was
further historical cause in the spread of Hellenistic civilisation,
which was of an entirely catholic spirit and welcomed disciples
from all nationalities<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>. The doctrine of Aristotle, that some
nations are by nature fitted only for slavery, finds no echo in
the Stoic world<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. There we look in vain for any trace of that
instinctive feeling of national difference, that sensitiveness to race
and colour, which can easily be recognised in the early history
of Greece and Rome, and which has become so acute in the
development of modern world-politics. The Roman Stoics, as
we shall see later, might individually be proud of advantages of
birth, but they never associated this feeling with their philosophy.
Here and there, however, we find signs of a scientific interest
in the question of differences of national character, which are
generally ascribed to the influences of climate. Seneca, for
instance, remarks that the inhabitants of northern climates have
characters as rude as their sky; hence they make good fighters,
but poor rulers<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. Yet when he contemplates the northern
barbarians, his mind is mainly occupied by admiration; and,
like other pro-Germans of the period, he foresees with prophetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
clearness a danger threatening the Roman empire. ‘Should the
Germans once lay aside their fierce domestic quarrels, and add
to their courage reason and discipline, Rome will indeed have
cause to resume the virtues of its early history<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.’ The roots
of true greatness of soul, then, lie deeper than in literary culture
or philosophic insight. It is a part of the irony of history that
Stoicism, which aimed above all things at being practical, should
diagnose so correctly the growing weakness of the Roman world,
and yet fail to suggest any remedy other than a reversion to an
epoch in which philosophy was unknown.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1210" href="#FNanchor_1210" class="label">[17]</a> Here we come into close touch with modern ways of thinking. The soul is
the self as known subjectively and from within, as appealed to in the argument of
Descartes ‘cogito, ergo sum.’ The body is the self as known objectively and from
without, first in our neighbours who obstruct our efforts (‘officium quod corporis
exstat, | officere atque obstare’ Lucr. <i>R. N.</i> i 337, 8), and then by analogy in
ourselves. The Stoic theory then asserts that subjective and objective knowledge
are ultimately the same, both being activities of the same Logos. See above, § <a href="#section149">149</a>.</p>

there being a mixture of the two, which however does not go beyond juxtaposition; in
the Stoic system soul permeates body. The Stoic explanation is frequently referred
to by opponents as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>: τῷ λέγοντι τὴν ψυχὴν σῶμα ἕπεται τὸ
σῶμα διὰ σώματος χωρεῖν Alex. Aphr. <i>Arist. Top.</i> ii 93 (Arnim ii 798). The relation
of the principate to the man as a whole is also called σύστασις (<i>constitutio</i>); ‘constitutio

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Right Law.</div>

<p id="section302"><b>302.</b> The department of Ethics contains two divisions:
ethics (in the stricter sense) which is concerned
with the action of the individual; and politics,
which has to do with the order of the State. It has been maintained
that in Stoicism the latter is altogether subordinated, and
that the central aim of this philosophy is to erect a shelter for
the individual<a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. The truth of this view is more than doubtful.
Stoic ethics are not based on the needs of the individual, but on
the demands of the supreme Law. ‘If there is a universe, then
there is a universal law, bidding us do this and refrain from that.’
‘If there are gods, there is virtue<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.’ We have already noticed
that Zeno’s earliest work was ‘on the State<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,’ and that it is an
attempt to show how a state can be ordered by wise laws. The
whole theory of the Logos leads up to the same point. The
same eternal Wisdom through which the primal stuff took shape
is, in another function, the Right Rule (ὀρθὸς λόγος, <i>vera ratio</i>)
which commands and forbids<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Right Rule and Common Law
(κοινὸς νόμος, <i>lex communis</i>) are terms of identical meaning, by
which a standard of supreme authority is set up<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; State law and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
conventional morality, though always of narrower range, and often
of inferior purity, are yet a reflection of universal Law. The moral
law must therefore first be studied in its bearings on man as a
political and social animal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cosmopolis.</div>

<p id="section303"><b>303.</b> The root-principle of the Stoic State is that it is world-wide,
a cosmopolis. This title arose from the
practice, attributed to Socrates and Diogenes (as
well as others), of replying to the current question ‘Of what city
are you?’ by the answer ‘Of the universe<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.’ We must therefore
regard ourselves as members not of a clan or city, but of a world-wide
society<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. In this society all distinctions of race, caste and
class are to be subordinated to the sense of kinship and brotherhood<a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.
This principle is equally opposed to the nationalist
prejudices which rank Hellene above barbarian, to philosophical
theories (such as that of Aristotle) which distinguish intelligent
peoples fitted by nature to rule and others only fitted to obey<a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>,
and to ideal states (such as that of Plato) in which a ruling class
is to be developed by artifice and schooling. Only the brute
animals are excluded from this community, for they are not
possessed of reason; they have therefore no rights, but exist
for the service of men<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. All human beings are capable of
attaining to virtue, and as such are natural-born citizens of the
Cosmopolis<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. Loyalty to this state, however, in no wise hinders
a due loyalty to existing states which may be regarded as partial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
realizations of it. Socrates submitted to the laws of Athens even
when they bade him die; Zeno and Cleanthes declined the citizenship
of that famous city, lest they should be thought to hold
cheap the places of their birth<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; and amongst the Romans Seneca
frequently insists that every man is born into two communities,
the Cosmopolis and his native city<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The law of nature.</div>

<p id="section304"><b>304.</b> The world-state is not held together either by force or
by state-craft, but by goodwill. We must be able
say ‘Love is god there, and is a helpmate to make
the city secure<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.’ This feeling of love and friendship grows up
naturally between wise men, because they partake in the reason
of the universe; so that we may equally well say that the bond
of the state is the Logos (<i>ratio atque oratio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. Since reason and
the universal law exist in the community from the beginning,
law does not need to be created; it exists of itself, and by
natural growth (φύσει)<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. The writing down of laws is only a
stage in their development<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Zeno’s revolutionary views.</div>

<p id="section305"><b>305.</b> The theory of the world-state, as first sketched by
Zeno, found no place for any of the cherished institutions
of the Athens in which it was preached.
In the heavenly city must be neither temples nor images<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; so
far the aims of the Persian invader are to be carried out. The
reason given is far from flattering to the artistic pride of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Athenians, for they are told that their magnificent buildings
and statues of world-wide renown are only the work of common
builders and workmen<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Nor must there be law-courts<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or
gymnasia. The practice of hearing both sides in a law-court
is unreasonable, because if the plaintiff has proved his case it
is useless to hear the defendant, and if he has not proved it, it is
superfluous<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. The training of the youth in grammar, music, and
gymnastic is worthless<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, for the true education is in virtue. Coined
money, as in modern communistic Utopias, should not be required
either for commerce or for travel<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Women to be in common.</div>

<p id="section306"><b>306.</b> With regard to the position of women Zeno, agreeing
to some extent with Plato, asserted the startling
doctrine that ‘women should be in common, and
men should mate with them as they pleased<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.’ That Zeno was
suggesting, even for an imaginary state, any sort of loose living,
need not for a moment be supposed; his continence was
notable<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>; he expressly approves of marriage<a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; and the members
of his school were honourably known by their aversion to
adultery<a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. But Zeno could not base his theory of the relation
of the sexes merely upon established practice. We may assume
that he observed that in the world of animals and of birds
mating was free<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, whereas in human society it was encumbered
by national prejudices, class privilege, and personal jealousy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
and in particular that woman was regarded as a chattel, contrary
to the fundamental principle of his state<a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. By his doctrine
of ‘free mating’ he aimed at the root of these evils. The gradual
abolition at Rome of the restrictions on ‘connubium’ illustrates
the application of his principle, just as the prohibition of ‘miscegenation’
in modern America illustrates its denial. Zeno may
well have perceived how deeply the potentiality of marriage
affects all social relations, and it is probable that the progress
of Stoicism did much to break down the racial barriers that
existed in Zeno’s time, but which had almost completely disappeared
five centuries later throughout the civilized world.
Another application of his doctrine is found in the life of Cato
of Utica<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. But its general meaning is clear: marriage exists
not by nature, but by institution (θέσει); its law is human and
mutable, but nevertheless within proper limits is one that may
not be transgressed. By the side of the text of Zeno we still
have the authorized comment of Epictetus<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incest no abomination.</div>

<p id="section307"><b>307.</b> The Stoics did not shrink from insisting upon the
abstract principle of the community of women even
in an extreme case in which their doctrine encountered
a violent prejudice. No natural law, they maintained,
prohibits marriage relationship between near relatives<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. The
tale of Oedipus and Jocasta, which is so prominent a theme in
the great Athenian tragedies, appears to Zeno to be a matter
about which too much ado has been made<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. For suppose the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
case that all the world were destroyed by flood except one man
and his daughter; would it not be better that he should beget
children by her, and that the whole human race should not
perish<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>? In this reference to the traditional flood we may
readily trace one reason why the Stoics insisted on their principle.
For at the beginning of human history we are compelled
to postulate an Adam and an Eve, a human pair related in their
birth and at the same time united as parents of the race<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. Go
back to the beginnings of the universe; there too we must
postulate the same combination of relationships, and so only
can we understand the poets when they speak of Hera as ‘wife
and sister of Zeus<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burial a convention.</div>

<p id="section308"><b>308.</b> Perhaps even more shocking to Hellenic feeling was
Zeno’s indifference to the treatment of the dead,
Burial was to him no sacred duty to the departed
one; it was equally right to throw the body to the fire, as the
Indians, or to the vultures, as the Persians<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. Nor is there any
need to condemn those nations amongst which the dead are
eaten by their own relatives<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, for all these things are matters
not of principle but of convenience, and to eat human flesh may
still be desirable if circumstances require it<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, as for instance in
shipwreck, or if a limb is amputated<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. The problem of the
disposal of the dead became a favourite subject of discussion
in Stoic circles. Chrysippus wrote at length on the subject,
comparing the customs of various nations as well as the habits
of animals, in order to ascertain the law of nature. He reaches
the conclusion that dead bodies should be disposed of in the
simplest possible way, not being regarded as of more importance
than the hair or nail-parings from which we part in life<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. Cicero
shortly sums up this discussion in the <i>Tusculan disputations</i>, and
draws the conclusion that whilst the living must consider what
it is fitting for them to do, to the dead man it is a matter totally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
indifferent<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. In the imperial period this consideration is of
importance as showing that the tyrant has no power after
death<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slavery.</div>

<p id="section309"><b>309.</b> The Stoic view of slavery can readily be inferred.
Without proposing the immediate abolition of this
social institution, the Stoics treated it as essentially
contrary to nature<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. The earliest teachers seem to have passed
over the subject in silence; Panaetius (as might be expected
from his social position), justified slavery by the arguments of
Plato and Aristotle in exceptional cases: ‘all those who through
the infirmity of their nature are unfit to govern themselves, are
rightly made slaves’<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. According to this theory we may speak
of a ‘natural slave’ (φύσει δοῦλος), who as such can no more
have rights in the community than the lower animals. The
true Stoic theory appears however to be formulated by a definition
of Chrysippus, who says that a slave is a ‘labourer hired for
life<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.’ This definition makes of slavery a contract, to which
there are two parties; and Seneca rightly uses this definition
to argue that the relations of master to slave are those of man
to man, and that as the master may wrong his slave, so the slave
may do a service to his master<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. All this is really implied in
the dogma that ‘women and slaves may become philosophers,’
as is realized by the Church Father Lactantius<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Constitutions.</div>

<p id="section310"><b>310.</b> The Stoic principles of politics may be realized under
any form of government, and the theory of Constitutions,
like that of grammar, belongs to a neutral
ground on which philosophers of different schools may work in
harmony. The Peripatetics appear first to have taken up this
study; of the Stoics Diogenes of Babylon<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, who himself acted
as a political representative of Athens, is stated to have shown
interest in this subject; and after him Panaetius developed a
complete theory, of which the substance is preserved for us in
Cicero’s <i>de Re publica</i><a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. According to this theory, which Cicero
puts in the mouth of Scipio Africanus, surrounded by Roman
Stoics of distinction such as Laelius, Tubero, and Furius Philo,
the best constitution is one in which the elements of monarchy,
aristocracy and democracy are combined, though a bias remains
in favour of monarchy<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. This mixed constitution, according to
the teaching of Panaetius and his pupil Polybius, is best illustrated
in the Roman state<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; whereas tyranny, the perversion of
monarchy, is the worst of all governments. By such reasoning
the Roman nobles of the first century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> and the first century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> alike persuaded themselves easily that Stoic teaching supported
the position of the republican party. But in fact they
were maintaining Peripatetic theories of government, and the
real Stoic theory was far more in accord with that practice of
the principate, according to which all citizens are treated with
respect, and the government of them is placed in the hands of
men selected for their personal merit. We shall discuss the
whole question of the relation of Stoicism to Roman politics
in a later chapter<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; but we may notice here that those Stoics
practically abandoned the theory of providence who looked
into the history of their own times with the intention of seeing
nowhere the ‘king,’ and everywhere the ‘tyrant.’ On the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
hand the practical statesmen who set about to re-create Roman
law on the principle of substituting everywhere human rights
for class privileges were men thoroughly imbued with the Stoic
spirit, whether or not they were avowed disciples of this philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The citizen.</div>

<p id="section311"><b>311.</b> We must therefore maintain that the true Stoic state,
whether it be called monarchy or democracy, calls
for a revolt against nationalism, antiquity, custom,
pride, and prejudice; and a new construction based upon universal
reason and individual liberty. For the realization of this
state it is first necessary to build up the individual, to fill his
mind with the conception of reason and love, to strengthen his
will to a true independence: for it is not buying or selling that
makes the slave, but the will within<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. All are in truth slaves
except the wise man; for freedom is the power of directing
one’s own actions<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Here then we pass from the community
to the individual, from politics to ethics in the narrower
sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The supreme good.</div>

<p id="section312"><b>312.</b> For the individual man the ethical problem is to
bring himself, a part of nature, into harmony with
the whole. Whether we think of destiny, of providence,
of the gods, or of the state, success for the individual
is to agree and to cooperate; to struggle and to rebel is to fail.
This success is the end (τέλος) for which man exists, the supreme
good (<i>summum bonum</i>), the ultimate good (<i>ultimum bonorum</i>),
that towards which all other right action works, whilst it works
itself for no other end<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. Its name in the individual is virtue
(ἀρετή, <i>virtus</i>), and it is an active and firmly-established disposition
of the soul<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. It follows from the monistic principle
that the end for man is one, and that virtue is one; but nevertheless
each is capable of being regarded in many aspects. The
harmony of the ethical end with other parts of the Stoic philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
is marked by such phrases as ‘life according to nature<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>,’
the rule ‘keep company with God<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>,’ and the identification of
virtue and reason<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consistency with nature.</div>

<p id="section313"><b>313.</b> Because virtue is one thing and not many, it makes
a man’s life one consistent whole, and stands in
sharp contrast to the changing and undecided
ways of the crowd. Virtue is therefore frequently defined as
consistency in life<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, an even steady course of action<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, self-consistency<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>,
a principle in agreement with its applications<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The
opposite of virtue is the unending restlessness and indecision of
the man in the crowd<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. Accordingly we are told that the earliest
Stoics thought it a sufficient definition of wisdom or virtue that
it was something simple<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; and similarly Zeno said that the end
of life was ‘to live consistently<a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.’ To this short definition the
words ‘with nature’ were soon added<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, whereby the distinctiveness
of the original definition was diminished: for all the
philosophical schools are agreed that the right life must be
guided by nature (φύσει), not by convention (θέσει). From the
time of Chrysippus the relation of right living to nature was
further analyzed. Chrysippus defined the ‘nature’ referred to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
as ‘universal and human nature<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>,’ thereby further approximating
to the teaching of rival schools; but on the other hand he gave
this new and more characteristic explanation ‘to live virtuously
is to live according to scientific knowledge of the phenomena of
nature, doing nothing which the Universal Law forbids, which is
the Right Reason which pervades all things, and is the same
as Zeus, the Lord of the ordering of this world<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.’ Diogenes of
Babylon introduced the words ‘to take a reasonable course in
choosing or refusing things in accordance with nature<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.’ Antipater’s
definition is ‘to live with preference for what is natural,
and aversion to what is against nature<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>,’ thus throwing the stress
on the doctrine of the ‘things of high degree<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.’ Panaetius made
a distinct step forward when he admitted the claims of universal
nature to be supreme, but (subject to them) held that each man
should follow the pointings of his individual nature<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; this
teaching however comes rather near to naming a twofold end.
Cicero follows Panaetius in his <i>de Officiis</i><a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, but in the <i>de Finibus</i>
adheres more closely to Chrysippus<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, and Seneca agrees with
him in laying stress on the need of scientific knowledge of
natural events<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. In the main therefore ‘life according to nature’
means to the Stoics life in accordance with the general movement
of the universe, to which the particular strivings of the individual
must be subordinated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obedience to God.</div>

<p id="section314"><b>314.</b> From the religious standpoint virtue is willing cooperation
with the deity, in preference to that unwilling
cooperation to which even evil-doers are forced.
This conception, first set forth by Cleanthes in a poem that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
have quoted above<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, is enforced by Seneca and Epictetus also
in varying phrases. ‘I do not obey God,’ says Seneca, ‘I agree
with him. I go with him heart and soul, and not because I must<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.’
With a slight change of language this leads us to the paradox
that ‘obedience to God is liberty<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.’ ‘I have placed my impulses,’
says Epictetus, ‘in obedience to God. Is it his will that
I shall have fever? It is my will too. Is it his will that I should
obtain anything? It is my wish also. Does he not wish it? I
do not wish it<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.’ The personal bent of Epictetus leads him to
develope this idea in the direction of suffering rather than of
acting. ‘If the good man had foreknowledge of what would
happen, he would cooperate towards his own sickness and death
and mutilation, since he knows that these things are assigned
to him in accordance with the universal arrangement<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.’ The
proof that this must be so rests on the unity of the Divine and
individual purposes: ‘Good cannot be one thing, and that at
which we are rationally delighted another thing<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Social duty.</div>

<p id="section315"><b>315.</b> It is not perhaps quite so clearly stated that the virtue
of the individual is that disposition which will make
him the best possible member of society, that is, the
best possible citizen of the Cosmopolis. Yet this is everywhere
implied. In the first place the wise man will take part in the
life of the community<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, he will marry and bring up children<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.
In the second place the virtue of man differs first from the
corresponding quality in the animals in that man is formed by
nature for social union; hence his reason only comes into play
simultaneously with the recognition that he is a member of a
community, and as such bound to prefer the good of the whole
to that of a part. ‘Nature,’ says Panaetius, ‘through reason
unites man to man, so that they have a common bond in conversation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and life; it induces men to approve and take part in
public gatherings and festivals, and to collect the materials for
a social and cultivated life for themselves, their children, and all
whom they hold dear<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health of soul.</div>

<p id="section316"><b>316.</b> Virtue, as a disposition of the soul<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, reflects all the
aspects in which the soul itself is regarded. Since
the principate is both wisdom and will, so virtue is
wisdom, according to the paradox of Socrates and the Cynics<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.
Because virtue is wisdom, it can be taught<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>; in fact, it can only
be acquired by teaching; and equally evil-doing can be cured
by teaching<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. But no less virtue is will. Cleanthes emphasized
this aspect, and identified virtue both with the Socratic ‘strength
of character’ and with the Stoic ‘tone<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.’ In so far as virtue is
will, it is to be acquired by constant practice<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. A true judgment
is endangered by hasty assent; a healthy will by slackness of
the soul’s sinews. In the Stoic system vigour and strength
of mind is everywhere identified with the ‘true tone’ (εὐτονία)<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>;
the possibility of overstrain is not considered. But in the development
of the ideal we have two varying aspects of virtue
presented to us. At one moment we see the man of action,
engaged in the thick of the battle, sun-browned, dusty, horny-handed<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>;
with this model before him we find Musonius objecting
altogether to relaxation of moral tone as being equivalent to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
loss<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. At another moment we see the man of quiet conviction,
who goes his way unmoved in the face of the howls of the mob
or the threats of the tyrant<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>; he is distinguished by a mental
calm<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> which no storms can shake. Any discrepancy between
these views is finally reconciled by introducing a comparison
between the soul and the body. The philosophers had at all
times been greatly influenced by the theories and practice of
the physicians; and they were proud to call themselves physicians
of the soul.’ Chrysippus spent much time in comparing
diseases of the soul to those of the body<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. Equally there must
be a healthy state of the soul corresponding to that of the body,
in which all its parts are in harmony<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. Hence in the Stoic
prayer health of soul is asked for, side by side with health of
body<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>; and Seneca bases a singularly complete statement of
the Stoic conception of happiness upon a permanently healthy
condition of the mind<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtue lies in intention.</div>

<p id="section317"><b>317.</b> Virtue is a state of the mind, a disposition of the
soul; it is not an act. Hence the bent of the mind
(<i>inclinatio</i>), its aim (<i>intentio</i>), its desire (βούλησις,
<i>voluntas</i>) is everything; the performance through the organs of
the body is nothing<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. This Stoic dogma is to-day so familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
in divinity, law, and society that it is not easy to realize how
paradoxical it seemed when first stated. By its proclamation
the Stoics defied the whole system of <i>tabu</i> by which the ancient
world prohibited certain acts as in themselves dangerous and
detestable; a system still in force in many departments of life
and theoretically defended by the ‘intuitive system of morals.’
The defenders of <i>tabu</i> were bitterly affronted, and indignantly
asked questions which mostly concerned the sexual relations,
with regard to which <i>tabu</i> appears to have been at the time
most vigorous. ‘Is there nothing wrong in cannibalism? in
foul language? in incest? in the accursed relations with boy
favourites (παιδικά)?’ To these questions firm-minded Stoics
were bound to give a negative answer, thereby laying themselves
open to the charge of being defenders of immorality.
This charge however is never to be taken seriously; the high
practical morality of the Stoics placed them beyond reproach.
But it was also easy to raise a laugh by quotations from these
austere moralists which sounded like a defence of licentiousness.
The solution of the difficulty in each individual case follows
exactly the same lines as in politics; and there is the same
divergence of method between the early Stoics, who assert their
principles at all costs, and those of the transition period, who are
intent upon adapting them to the existing conditions of society.
Here we need only discuss the questions of principle, as we deal
with questions affecting practical life in another chapter<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tabus.</div>

<p id="section318"><b>318.</b> The principal <i>tabus</i> affecting the individual have to do
with cannibalism, the sexual relations, nudity, and
obscenity. Of the first we have already spoken;
the other three appeared to the Stoics partly due to inherited
prejudices, partly to the theory that the body is in itself vile
and corrupt. Of neither point of view could the Stoics approve.
Hence their repeated assertions that no sexual act, whether
commonly described as natural or as unnatural, is <i>in itself</i> to
be condemned, but only according as it is seemly or unseemly
for the individual<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. It was perhaps unnecessary to explain to
Greeks that the naked body is in itself no offensive sight, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
doubtless the Stoics had to make this clear to their Oriental
pupils; Zeno at any rate laid down the principle when he said
that men and women should wear the same clothes (meaning
such as nature requires for warmth and not such as fashion
prescribes), and hide no part of the body<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. As to decency of
language, it did not occur to the Stoics to discuss this question
in connexion with the history of literature. Since truth is
always good, and the very purpose of language is to express
truth, a wise man will always say straight out what he needs
to say<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtue in its applications.</div>

<p id="section319"><b>319.</b> Up to this point we find a broad resemblance between
the ethical principles of the Stoics and the Cynics.
Both assert the sole supremacy of virtue, ridicule
traditional prejudices, and bid defiance to external circumstances.
But there is at the same time divergence. To the Cynics virtue
stands out as alone, needing no theory, and by itself in the
universe. To the Stoics virtue is but one expression of that
universal reason which is equally at work in the universe and in
the human mind. The Stoics are therefore under the obligation
of bringing virtue into touch with circumstances, the soul into
harmony with the body. From this arises their doctrine that
virtue is bound up with the study both of universal and of
individual nature, and that amongst things indifferent there are
some that the good man must seek, and others that he must
avoid. The critics of Stoicism, both ancient and modern, regard
this doctrine as an afterthought<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>, suggested by practical difficulties,
and alien from the original teaching of Zeno. This seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
to be a misapprehension. Undoubtedly Zeno had said: ‘some
things are good, some are evil, some indifferent. Good are
wisdom, temperance, justice, fortitude, everything that is virtue
or an aspect of virtue; evil are folly, intemperance, injustice,
cowardice, everything that is vice or an aspect of vice. Indifferent
are life and death, glory and disgrace, pain and pleasure,
riches and wealth, disease, health, and so forth<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.’ But there is
a difference between a principle and its application; and this
very list of things indifferent indicates by its contrasts an underlying
difference, though it is not the difference between good
and evil. Zeno was therefore quite consistent in proceeding to
examine the nature of this difference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worth and Unworth.</div>

<p id="section320"><b>320.</b> This secondary difference is termed by the Stoics a
difference of worth (ἀξία, <i>aestimatio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. Health,
life, riches, have positive worth in greater or less
degree; disease, death, poverty, have negative worth (ἀπαξία,
<i>inaestimabile</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. Between these lie things that are absolutely
indifferent, as, for example, whether the number of hairs on
one’s head is odd or even<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>, or whether we take up one or the
other of two coins that have the same general appearance and
the same stamp<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. Even here a slight distinction has to be
made; as to whether the hairs on the head are odd or even in
number we have not the slightest concern; but in the matter of
the coins we must make a choice, and that quickly. Let us then
settle the matter anyhow, by chance as common folk say; ‘for
a reason that is not clear to us,’ as the Stoics say, not willing to
admit an effect without a cause, and yet leaving the matter much
where it was<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. And now as to the things that have ‘worth’; it
is clear that in some sense they are ‘according to nature,’ and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
the same sense those things that have ‘negative worth’ are opposed
to nature<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>; and the former in some way approximate to
the character of the good<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. It is then necessary to describe
them by some term other than ‘good.’ Zeno selected the term
προηγμένον ‘of high degree,’ which Cicero translates variously
by <i>producta</i>, <i>promota</i>, <i>praecipua</i>, <i>praelata</i>, and <i>praeposita</i>. This
term, we are told, Zeno borrowed from court life: ‘for no one
would think of calling a king “of high degree,” but only those
who are of a rank next to his, though far below<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.’ The opposites
were described as ἀποπροηγμένα (<i>remota</i>, <i>reiecta</i>) ‘things
of low degree<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.’ Seneca, who states the theory with great
clearness<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, commonly uses the handier terms <i>commoda</i> (‘advantages’)
and <i>incommoda</i> (‘disadvantages’)<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. In their treatment
of the separate matters which fall under these divisions the Stoics
were in close agreement with the Peripatetic theory of natural
ends (τὰ κατὰ φύσιν)<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>: but their loyalty to their own school
came into question, if they actually termed them ‘good’ or
‘evil,’ as Chrysippus thought permissible if sufficient precautions
were taken<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, and as Seneca often describes them in his less
careful moods<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The aim of virtue.</div>

<p id="section321"><b>321.</b> The advocates of Stoicism maintain that the theory
of ‘advantages’ is essential to their system, because
without it virtue has no meaning, and practical
life no guide<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; whereas as soon as this theory is established,
we can assign to virtue the permanent and distinctive character,
that it aims at securing ‘advantages’ and avoiding ‘disadvantages<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.’
Now we are able to enlarge, though we do not alter,
our definition of the supreme good; the ‘consistent life,’ the
‘life consistent with nature,’ is the ‘life which is accompanied by
a true knowledge of the things that happen by nature’; to which
words we now add ‘choosing those things which are in accordance
with nature, and avoiding those things which are against
nature<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.’ Nevertheless, virtue consists wholly in the aiming at
the mark, and not at all in the hitting it. As the true sportsman
finds all his pleasure in throwing his quoit according to the rules
of the game, and in aiming his arrow at the centre of the target,
but cares not in the least (so it would seem) whether he succeeds<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>;
so the wise man, even though (by those circumstances
which he cannot control, and which in this connexion we call
‘the play of fortune’) he gain no ‘advantage’ at all, but suffer
dishonour, captivity, mutilation, and death, still possesses the
supreme good, still is as completely happy as though he enjoyed
all things. This is the Stoic doctrine of the ‘sufficiency of virtue,’
expressed in the language of paradox, but nevertheless the central
point of their whole ethical system; and its force is really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
intensified by the doctrine of ‘advantages,’ which to a superficial
critic appears to relax it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sufficiency of virtue.</div>

<p id="section322"><b>322.</b> The doctrine of the sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια, <i>sufficientia</i>)
of virtue was consistently taught by the Stoics of
all periods, though in ever-varying phraseology.
Zeno adopted the Cynic phrase ‘virtue is sufficient for happiness,’
or in other words ‘virtue needs but herself for a happy
life<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.’ Chrysippus maintains that there are only three logical
views as to the supreme good, that it is virtue or pleasure or
both<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, and for himself he chooses the first. Happiness therefore
is not made greater if advantages are added to virtue; or
rather, virtue does not permit addition (<i>accessio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. In the transition
period Antipater of Tarsus is said to have faltered, and to
have attributed a little importance, though very little, to external
advantages<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>; but, as we have seen above<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>, his definition of the
supreme good is in full accord with the general teaching of the
school. Panaetius and Posidonius held to the orthodox doctrine
both in word and deed, if we may trust the direct statements of
Cicero<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>; nevertheless they were so anxious to assimilate their
expressions to those of ordinary life, that the conclusion could
easily be drawn that in their hearts they too attached importance
to external goods<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. One authority indeed states that they held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
health, strength, and estate to be ‘needful’ for happiness, thus
abandoning the sufficiency of virtue<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>; but in the absence of
direct quotation we shall hardly be willing to accept this statement
as implying anything different from the distinction of
Chrysippus, viz. that ‘the wise man <i>needs</i> nothing, but <i>has use</i>
for everything<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.’ But any faltering shown by the transition
writers was more than made good by the zeal of the teachers
under the principate. Seneca enforces the paradox in a score
of phrases; in the form of a proverb ‘virtue is its own reward<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>’;
in rhetorical exuberance ‘virtue can defy death, ill
fortune, and tyranny<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>’; it is ‘independent even of the deity<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>’;
and ‘no circumstances can increase or impair its perfection<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.’
Epictetus often dwells on the same theme<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, and the whole work
of Marcus Aurelius is a meditation upon it<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. Nor is the dogma
merely scholastic; the teachers of the Roman period lay special
emphasis on the practical importance of upholding the ideal of
virtue, as alike single and complete in itself<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtue and the virtues.</div>

<p id="section323"><b>323.</b> But virtue, though single in its essence, is manifold in
its applications; though it can only be possessed as
a whole, it is attained by stages. By this amplification
of the Stoic doctrine the way is prepared for that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
adaptation of ethical doctrine to varieties of circumstance
which will be the special subject of our next chapter. By the
side of virtue stand ‘the virtues,’ sometimes conceived as virtue
herself endowed with various qualities<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>, more often as virtue
at work in different spheres of action. In this way virtue assumes
in turn the shape of each one of the four virtues as commonly
understood, namely Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Soberness<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>;
we may, if we please, reckon with a smaller or greater number<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>;
yet we must always remember that the virtues are so
knit together, that he who truly possesses one, possesses all<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.
Virtue again is displayed in single acts, each of which (whatever
its sphere) is a ‘right action’ (κατόρθωμα, <i>recte factum</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. In
proportion as virtue is displayed in its various qualities and
spheres, and in successive right actions, it gains itself a larger
field; it cannot be said to increase, but it is in a way spread
out and broadened<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How virtue is won.</div>

<p id="section324"><b>324.</b> Virtue, as it is displayed in individual men, has also
a history. This follows clearly from Stoic principles,
since virtue is an aspect of reason, and
children are not possessed of reason<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. Virtue therefore comes
by training, not by birth<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>; by art, not by nature<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. In the
period that precedes the attainment of virtue, there exist states
of the soul which are the semblances and the forerunners of
virtue; and he who is on his way towards wisdom, and whom
we call ‘the probationer’ (προκόπτων, <i>proficiens</i><a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>), by learning
and practice comes daily nearer to his goal, till in the crowning
moment he wins it as a whole; for virtue is no sum of lesser<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
dispositions reached by a gradual addition of item to item, but
a thing complete in itself<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>. Can virtue thus won be lost at a
later time? Virtue, it may seem, is not really such, unless it is
indestructible; and the Cynics and the earlier Stoics taught
accordingly that virtue cannot be lost<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, that it is a ‘possession
for ever.’ In this point, as in so many others, Chrysippus yielded
to criticism, and admitted that virtue might be lost through
intoxication or indigestion<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>, to which causes might well be
added the failure of the reason through insanity or old age<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.
But in spite of these difficulties the general feeling of the Stoic
school held firmly to the doctrine that virtue once acquired is
acquired for ever<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wise men.</div>

<p id="section325"><b>325.</b> Virtue and vice are not mere theories of the philosopher;
they exist and can be studied in human
shape, in the wise and foolish men of myth, history,
and society. The lesson of virtue in particular can best be learnt
by considering virtuous men<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. Here the Stoics followed closely
the teaching of their predecessors the Cynics<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. As the best of
models they accepted Hercules, the man rightly deemed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
god<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, who travelled over all the world, purging it of every
lawlessness, and bringing with him justice, holiness, and
peace<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. Next comes Ulysses, who like Hercules was untiring
in his labours, triumphant over pain, and a conqueror throughout
all the world<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>; an example to all men of endurance and
vigour<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. To barbarians Cyrus, king of Persia, was a like
example to prove that suffering is a good<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. Many such are
counted amongst the philosophers; first Heraclitus, not for his
insight into nature, but for his control over his passions<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>; then
Socrates, who in life and death was equally a model as a man
and as a citizen<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>. Diogenes the Cynic is worthy of special
honour, for he was so filled with love for mankind and obedience
to God, that he willingly undertook a life of labour and bodily
suffering, and thus won himself the true freedom<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, and became
truly happy, truly divine<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>. Zeno the most temperate of philosophers<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>,
and Cleanthes<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> the most enduring, were men of like
type within the Stoic school itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wise Romans.</div>

<p id="section326"><b>326.</b> To the list of wise men recognised by the Greeks the
Romans were proud to add other names from their
own history, thereby associating their philosophic
principles with patriotic pride. From their mythology Aeneas
was selected, the man who crushes his desires that he may
loyally cooperate with the destiny of his people; from the times
of the republic Scipio Africanus minor and his gentle companion
Laelius<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>; whilst in Publius Rutilius Rufus a Roman could be
found who, like Socrates, would not when on his trial consent to
any other defence than a plain statement of the facts, in which
he neither exaggerated his own merits nor made any plea for
mercy<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. But amongst all Romans Cato of Utica was pre-eminent<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.
If Cicero, as a contemporary and a colleague in
political life, was little liable to illusions as to his character and
success, his testimony to Cato’s sincerity is all the more valuable<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>;
nor can we believe that Cato’s voluntary death would so
soon and so greatly have stirred Roman feeling, had it not come
as the climax of a life worthily spent<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>. The period of the principate
brought to the front both men and women whose fearless
lives and quiet self-approved deaths proved them to be worthy
successors to the heroes of the past; and at the same time we
notice a disposition to find some at least of the elements of the
heroic character in simple uneducated folk, as in the soldier, the
athlete, and the gladiator, so that these too serve in their degree
as models for those that seek wisdom<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wise men are few.</div>

<p id="section327"><b>327.</b> The founders of Stoicism never doubted that wise men
had existed and did exist; they looked forward to
a time not far distant when there should be a Cosmopolis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
in which every citizen should be wise. This robust belief
was not maintained by their successors. According to Chrysippus,
only one or two wise men have ever existed<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>; and he
expressly denies that he himself or any of his acquaintance are
amongst the number<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. The Stoics of the transition period
avoided the topic as troublesome<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>; and their opponents naturally
pressed it on them all the more. Zeno had said ‘It is
reasonable to honour the gods: it is not reasonable to honour
the non-existent: therefore the gods exist.’ This was now
parodied: ‘It is reasonable to honour wise men: it is not reasonable
to honour the non-existent: therefore wise men exist.’ If
this argument was unsatisfactory, as we are told<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>, to the Stoics,
because they had not yet discovered their wise man anywhere,
we are not surprised to find that sometimes they refer him to
the golden age<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>, at other times convert him into an ideal<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.
The Stoics under the Roman principate re-affirmed vigorously
the existence of the wise man<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. Seneca however admits that
his appearance is as rare as that of the phoenix<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>, and altogether
disclaims any such character for himself individually<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. Epictetus
is far more true to the spirit of the old doctrine, when he
not only abstains from any morbid depreciation of his own
character, but also urges his pupils never to give up the hope
of reaching perfection<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The glory of virtue.</div>

<p id="section328"><b>328.</b> Thus the Stoics founded their moral ideal on the triple
basis of the good citizen, the healthily-disposed soul,
and the examples of wise men. In impressing this
part of their system on their pupils, they made little use of definitions
or syllogisms, but all the more they resorted to rhetorical
description. As in their physics the Logos became almost a
person, so here the picture of Virtue is drawn, as by Prodicus
in the old allegory of the choice of Hercules, drawing men to
her not by the pleasures she offers but by her majesty and
beauty<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>. Cleanthes in particular heaps epithets of praise on
virtue<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>; more usually it is sufficient to insist that virtue is good,
praiseworthy, and expedient. That ‘the wise man is a king<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>’
almost ceases to be a paradox, since the soul is rightly compared
to a kingdom; that he is rich, handsome, free, and invincible can
equally be argued on Stoic principles<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. To carry such statements
further seems to savour of pedantry, to ridicule them at
any stage is easy. Yet the statement that seems the boldest
of all, that ‘the wise man is happy even on the rack<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>,’ was
many a time verified by the experience of individual Stoics<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>.
That the wise man is a god, though subject to the limitations of
mortality, is maintained without hesitation<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoic ethics.</div>

<p id="section329"><b>329.</b> The Stoic morality differs not only in form and in its
reasoned basis, but in substance, both from the
popular morality of the time and the ideals of
rival philosophical schools. The Stoic heroes differ from those
of Homer by a world-age; they possess what the Romans called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
<i>humanitas</i>, powers of reasoning and of sympathizing unknown
to an age of warriors. The Epicurean sage was not, as popular
criticism and that of many Stoics unjustly described him, a man
of gross tastes and reckless selfishness; but he was essentially
easy-going and a quietist, little inclined to risk his peace of mind
by meddling with the troubles of others. To the Cynics the
Stoics owed much in their principles, to the Academics (as we
shall see) much in their application of them; they stood between
the two, more reasonable and judicious than the former, firmer
in principle than the latter, possessed of a breadth of outlook
which neither of these schools could claim.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From principles to practice.</div>

<p id="section330"><b>330.</b> As in our study of the Stoic philosophy we turn aside
from the supreme problems of the universe, such as
gather round the questions of the divine purpose,
the existence of evil, and unfettered choice, our way
becomes easier. Our new problems, dealing with the constitution
of the human soul, and the ideals of human life in the state and
in the individual, are perhaps not simpler in themselves, but they
are of narrower range, and in finding our way over the first rough
ground we learn to tread with some assurance, so that we now
feel ourselves, as it were, on a downward path. For all that, the
problems of the universal law and the perfect man must still be
compared to mountain tops, if not to the highest peaks of all.
But from this point on we steadily descend towards the plains,
to that common and practical life by which the worth of philosophy
is tested. We no longer gaze on the same bright sunlight
or breathe the same invigorating air; philosophy enters a region
of mists and shadows, and even learns to adapt her language to
new neighbours. But her meaning is the same as before, and
the pathway to the heights is not closed behind her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The daily round.</div>

<p id="section331"><b>331.</b> The region we have now reached is that of ‘daily
duties,’ by which phrase we propose to translate
here the Greek καθήκοντα and the Latin <i>officia</i><a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.
This word is defined by Zeno as meaning ‘that which it comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
in one’s way to do<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,’ and its quiet sound at once brings it into
contrast with the proud claims of Virtue. The contrast is in
fact great. Virtue, displaying itself in Right Action, is only
possible for reasoning beings, that is, for gods and men; and
within our view it is only attained, if at all, by the wise man.
But daily duty is common to the wise and the unwise<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; it not
only extends to children, but also to the unreasoning animals<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and to plants<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Virtue always contemplates the Universal law;
for daily duty it is sufficient to follow the individual nature<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
Virtue cannot even be understood except by the trained philosopher,
whilst the principles of daily duty may be explained to
the simple. To use a comparison from mathematics, daily duty
is the projection of virtue upon the plane of ordinary life. Between
the two there always remains an assured correspondence.
Each Right Action which Virtue achieves is at the same time
the performance of a daily duty, and that in the most complete
manner<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; each daily duty performed by the unwise is a step by
which he may in the end climb to Wisdom<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First laws of nature.</div>

<p id="section332"><b>332.</b> The subject of ‘daily duties’ was treated both by Zeno<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and by Cleanthes<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, and is implied in the theory of
Stoic ethics as a whole; it has also a special relation
to the doctrine of advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless
the Stoics do not directly say that daily duty consists in the
seeking of advantages, but that it is based upon primary ends
which nature sets up (πρῶτα κατὰ φύσιν, <i>principia naturae</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
This phrase indicates the source of this part of the Stoic philosophy;
it marks teaching common to the Peripatetic school and
the Academy, and accepted by Zeno from his teacher Polemo<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.
We are not informed how Zeno and Cleanthes elaborated this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
subject; and when we find it taken up in earnest, the spirit of
the Academy is firmly established. Thus the Stoic demand for
certain knowledge is here set aside; and we are told that the
standard of daily duty is ‘that which when done can reasonably
be defended<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>’; which definition closely corresponds with the definition
of the supreme good by Diogenes of Babylon ‘to take a
reasonable course in the choice of things according to nature<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.’
Thus strong will and assured conviction are no longer required;
the door is thrown open for convention, opportunism, and respectability.
The daring moral theories and bold paradoxes of the
founders of Stoicism tend to disappear from sight, and are replaced
by shrewd good sense and worldly wisdom: in short, by
the doctrine of ‘making the best of both worlds.’ The subject
was therefore congenial to Panaetius, who was both a practical
statesman and an admirer of Plato and Aristotle; and it was
from this standpoint that Stoicism so rapidly won its way with
the Roman nobility of the last century of the republic. Panaetius’
book περὶ καθηκόντων was the basis of Cicero’s work <i>de
Officiis</i>, which is the only systematic treatise which we possess
on Stoic ethics, and therefore generally the most convenient
source of information. As however this work leans very strongly
towards Peripatetic views, it will frequently be necessary to refer
to other authorities, amongst which Cicero’s <i>de Finibus</i> best
represents the older Stoics, and Seneca and Epictetus the Stoics
of the Roman principate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">From the animals to man.</div>

<p id="section333"><b>333.</b> It is no departure from the fundamental principles of
Stoicism when we learn that the ‘first lessons of
nature’ are those which are imprinted upon every
animal at its birth<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; Zeno himself had sought for
the natural law of marriage by a like method<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. The first natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
lesson is that each animal seeks, not indeed pleasure as the
Epicureans hold, but its own preservation and the maintenance
of its life in its completeness<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. At a later stage is imparted the
desire of sexual union for procreation’s sake, and with it some
kind of affection for each one’s offspring<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. But nature’s best
lessons are reserved for man; as to look into the future, and
regard life as a whole<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; to interest himself in his fellows, to
attend public festivities, and to procure the amenities of a civilized
life for himself and those dependent upon him<a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; in spare
hours, to acquire information on points of historical or philosophical
interest<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; in riper life to claim freedom, and to refuse
to submit to any arbitrary commands<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>; and finally, to perceive
in all things harmony and beauty, and to avoid any disturbance
of it by wilful action<a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. ‘Such,’ says Cicero, ‘is the picture of a
beautiful life; and could we see it with our eyes (as Plato says),
great would be our desire to possess Wisdom for a bride<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wavering as to the standard.</div>

<p id="section334"><b>334.</b> In this general sketch we miss a clear ethical standard.
The first lessons of nature may easily be perverted,
so far as they are common to men and animals, for
they point towards the acts of eating, drinking, and
sexual union, all of which are associated by the ordinary man
with pleasure in a vicious sense. Hence arises a danger (from
which many Stoics do not keep clear), that we may fall into the
terrible error of the Epicureans, and hold that pleasure itself is
a first law of nature<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. It is therefore necessary to lay it down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
that man should aim specially at those results which are characteristic
of human nature, that is at the development of powers
which he does not share with the lower animals. So far the
Academy and the Porch might travel together. But the only,
higher capacities recognised by the Stoics are reason and the
political sense, which is an aspect of the universal reason; such
matters as antiquarian interests and the appreciation of beauty
could only be introduced under Academic influence. The last,
however, as we shall see, is to become with Panaetius the predominant
consideration<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The four virtues.</div>

<p id="section335"><b>335.</b> From the enunciation of general principles we pass on
to the separate virtues. Virtue in the strict sense
can only be possessed by the wise man; he therefore
alone can practise the virtues; nevertheless we may use this
and like terms in a secondary sense to describe those adumbrations
or reflections of virtue which fall within the reach of the
ordinary man<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. The classification of the virtues varies. Panaetius
divided virtue into two parts, theoretical and practical, and
Seneca follows him on this point<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. It was perhaps Chrysippus
who distinguished between virtues that are ‘arts’ (τέχναι) and
which are based on theoretical principles, and those which are
‘acquirements’ (δυνάμεις), being attained by practice<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. But
generally speaking the division of Virtue into the four cardinal
virtues of Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Soberness is accepted
as sufficient; by subdivision the number of virtues may be increased
to any extent; and in scholastic classifications of virtue
we find lists which have multiplicity for their direct aim<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wisdom.</div>

<p id="section336"><b>336.</b> Wisdom (φρόνησις, <i>prudentia</i>) is considered by Zeno
not only as the first of the virtues, but as the foundation
of all; so that Courage is wisdom in suffering,
Justice is wisdom in distribution, and Soberness is wisdom in
enjoyment<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. His successors treated Science (ἐπιστήμη, <i>scientia</i>)
as the parent virtue<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, thus placing Wisdom side by side with the
other cardinal virtues, yet losing the point of Zeno’s genealogy.
The writers of the later periods desired to recognise separately
contemplative wisdom, and therefore introduced as a subdivision
of the first cardinal virtue ‘Speculation’ (σοφία, <i>sapientia</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. But
the Stoics generally held that all wisdom must justify itself by
practical results. The study of the so-called ‘liberal arts’ has a
value for children, for it prepares the way for virtuous training<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.
Logic is needed to protect us against fallacious reasoning<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, and
physics that we may rightly understand the universe and its
providential government, upon which the conception of duty
depends<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; in this sense we may speak of logic and physics as
virtues, that is, as subdivisions of the virtue of wisdom<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. The
study of physics is also admirable because it elevates the soul<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
Geometry, law, and astrology are useful in the several professions<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
But study when carried to excess, as by antiquarians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
bookworms, and other learned time-wasters, is nothing but
folly<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Justice.</div>

<p id="section337"><b>337.</b> The second cardinal virtue is Justice (δικαιοσύνη, <i>iustitia</i>),
of which Chrysippus drew a striking allegorical
picture. ‘She is of virgin form, to show that
she is incorruptible and does not give way to bad men; ... of firm
and fierce aspect, ... inspiring fear in the wicked, confidence in the
good; her eyes are keen-sighted, her bearing is at once sad and
awe-inspiring<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.’ Cicero distinguishes Justice in the narrower
sense from ‘Beneficence.’ Justice proper is a political virtue,
and consists in respect for the rights and property of individuals.
By nature indeed all things are common; but since they have
become private property by occupation, conquest, law, contract,
and so forth, individuals may keep their own, provided they do
not forget that they have always the duty of contributing to the
common good<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, and that even slaves have reasonable claims
upon them<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. Beneficence needs the guidance of principle, and
must be determined by considerations of person and occasion.
The claims of persons upon us depend on propinquity; country,
parents, wife and children must be first considered, then other
relatives, then fellow-citizens, lastly men in general<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. The consideration
of the degrees of propinquity (σχέσεις) was a favourite
subject with Epictetus, and a useful defence against those who
maintained that the Stoic sage was lacking in natural affection<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.
The virtue of Justice appealed specially to the statesman in both
its applications, and is dealt with fully by Panaetius, and by
Cicero after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Courage.</div>

<p id="section338"><b>338.</b> The third cardinal virtue is Courage (ἀνδρεία, <i>fortitudo</i>),
which retains the tradition of the ‘strength and
force’ of Socrates. This again, according to Cicero,
has two parts, one passive, which consists in despising fortune
and its buffets, and is in harmony with the picture of the wise
man as usually drawn; the other part, which we may call Greatness
of Soul (μεγαλοψυχία, <i>magnitudo animi</i>) is shown in the
undertaking of great enterprises. The virtue of Courage is characteristically
Stoic, and may be considered, like its counterpart
Wisdom, as the foundation and source of all the virtues; the
knowledge of good and evil can only be attained by the soul
that is duly strung to vigorous resolution<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. The Stoics of the
principate perhaps insist most of all on this virtue, which alone
makes men independent of all that it lies with Fortune to give
and to take away. The man of courage will therefore detach
himself from fortune’s gifts; he will treat them as household
furniture lent to him which may be at any moment recalled<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death not to be feared.</div>

<p id="section339"><b>339.</b> Courage appears in its highest development in the
face of tyranny and death. It is the tyrant’s boast
that he has men in his power: but the brave man
is an exception. His rank and his property may be taken away;
he may be subjected to the torture; his life may be forfeited;
but the soul, that is the man himself, is beyond the tyrant’s
reach<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. To pain he answers ‘if I can bear it, it will be light;
if I cannot bear it, it cannot be long<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.’ Amidst all the extremities
of fire and rack men have been found who never groaned,
never begged for mercy, never answered a question, and indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
laughed heartily<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. Of death the Stoic has no fear; not only is
it no evil, but it is to be welcomed as part of the course of
nature<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>; it is the best of friends, for it offers a release from all
troubles, and in particular from the oppression of the tyrant<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
We do not indeed deny that normally life is an advantage, that
nature’s first lesson is self-preservation, and that death in itself
is a thing terrible to contemplate<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>; but life is not the more
desirable for its length<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; and when old age begins to shatter
the powers of the mind, and to degrade the man to the life of
a vegetable, nature is calling him to quit his mortal body<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. At
no period is life worth purchasing at the cost of the loss of honour,
without which it loses its savour<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. The philosopher therefore
will not merely see with calm confidence the approach of death;
he will go forward to meet it of his own free will, if only he is
assured that reasonable choice points that way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasonable departure.</div>

<p id="section340"><b>340.</b> The doctrine of ‘reasonable departure’ (εὔλογος ἐξαγωγή,
<i>rationalis e vita excessus</i>) plays a prominent
part in the Stoic ethics. It cannot rightly be described
as the recommendation of suicide; for the Stoics do not
permit a man to pass sentence of death upon himself, but only
to cooperate in carrying out the decree of a higher power. The
doctrine is intended in the first instance to justify death gloriously
met in fighting for one’s country or one’s friends; next
when intolerable pain or incurable disease plainly indicates the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
will of the deity<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; in the development of Roman history a third
reason was found in the loss of political freedom<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. These
reasons are not added to, but only systematized, when we are
told that it is an ‘ordinary duty’ to quit life when a man’s
natural advantages (τὰ κατὰ φύσιν) are outweighed by the
corresponding disadvantages<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>; for amongst ‘natural advantages’
are included in this connexion all those considerations
of which an honourable man will rightly take account; and the
calculation may equally lead him to the conclusion that, in spite
of old age and suffering, and though he has never attained to
true wisdom, his simple duty is to wait quietly in life<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its dangers.</div>

<p id="section341"><b>341.</b> The practice of ‘reasonable departure’ was largely
recommended to the Stoics by the examples of
Socrates (whose death they regarded as voluntary<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>)
and of Cato<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; and it was at first no small matter of pride to
them to find that these examples found imitators, and that their
system thus showed its power over the greatest of the terrors
that beset humanity. But under the Roman principate ‘free
departure’ soon became so common that it was a reproach
rather than a glory to its advocates, a social disease pointing
to morbidity of soul rather than to healthy resolution<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
the philosophers turned from recommendation to reproof. ‘A
brave and wise man must not flee from life, but quit it,’ says
Seneca<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>; ‘nothing is more disgraceful than to long for death’<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.
‘Friends,’ says Epictetus, ‘wait for God; when he shall give you
the signal, then go to him<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Courage is active.</div>

<p id="section342"><b>342.</b> The ‘free departure’ is the most striking illustration
of passive courage, but even before it was abused
Cicero at least had perceived the attraction which
this attitude of soul possesses, and its opposition to the spirit
of active enterprise which he calls Greatness of Soul, and which
he advocates perhaps more on Academic than on Stoic lines.
Still the Stoics had already defined Courage as ‘virtue fighting
in the front rank in defence of justice<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.’ A good man must
indeed regard power and wealth as things indifferent; but he
is to be blamed if he makes this an excuse for avoiding public
life, and leaving to others magistracies at home or commands
in the wars<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. In the old world the love of glory and praise
on the one hand, angry feeling against enemies on the other,
has led men to seek these positions; but now they should seek
them at home that they may have a wide field for the exercise
of their virtues<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, and in the wars in order that all war may be
brought to an end<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. By the older Stoics this Greatheartedness
was advocated by precept and example: Zeno had said that
the wise man should take part in public life<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, and his hearers
Persaeus and Philonides had taken service under Antigonus
Gonatas<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, and Sphaerus with Cleomenes III, king of Sparta<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.
We shall see later how large was the part played in Roman
political life by men who were Stoics or inclined to Stoicism, in
an age in which there was a strong current of fashion in favour
of a quiet life. We must therefore recognise in Courage, fully
as much as in Wisdom or Justice, a political as well as a
private virtue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Soberness.</div>

<p id="section343"><b>343.</b> The fourth cardinal virtue is Soberness (σωφροσύνη,
<i>temperantia</i>). Of this there are various definitions,
and amongst them that it is the principle which
regulates our natural appetites so that they are neither in excess
nor in defect<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. From Cicero’s point of view Soberness embraces
all the virtues, for it is in the due regulation of the impulses that
virtue consists. The standard to be attained is a healthy state
of the soul; and this is to be judged, upon the analogy of the
body, by the canon of that which is beautiful, symmetrical, and
becoming (πρέπον, <i>decorum</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. ‘Just as bodily beauty is symmetry
established between the limbs mutually, and also between
each and the whole body, so beauty of the soul is symmetry
between the reasoning power and its parts, and mutually between
each of those parts<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.’ Although this is in principle a doctrine
accepted by the whole Stoic school, yet in its application we
may easily find an entirely new departure, that is, if the appeal
is made to an artistic standard which depends upon the taste
of the individual. The door is then thrown open to an abandonment
of the Cynico-Stoic theory of life according to reason,
and to the acceptance of the standard of good feeling, which
may easily be so stretched as to include existing prejudices
and conventions. This danger is realized in Cicero’s treatment
of the virtue of ‘decorum,’ which in its distinctive sense is defined
as having the element of ‘gentlemanliness’ in itself<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. It
begins with respect for the feelings and opinions of others<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>;
it avoids all rough games and obscene jests<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>; it makes choice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
of a profession adapted to the natural character of the individual<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>;
it observes, as the actor does, the proprieties of youth
and age, rich and poor, citizen and foreigner<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>; it prescribes
dignity as fitting for men, gracefulness for women<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. In particular
decorum is displayed in modesty (<i>verecundia</i>). This is
shown by keeping out of sight those parts of the body which
nature, though she could not dispense with them, has concealed
and covered; in attending to their functions with the utmost
secrecy; and in referring both to these parts of the body and
to their uses by words that do not properly describe them<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cynism or ‘decorum’?</div>

<p id="section344"><b>344.</b> Cicero’s treatment of ‘decorum’ is so full of good sense
that his <i>de Officiis</i> was the most widely-known textbook
of Greco-Roman ethics in medieval schools,
and has retained its importance in the classical public schools
of the present day. But its logical justification on Stoic principles
is far from easy. We are therefore not surprised to find
that, just as Zeno and the main body of his followers had proclaimed
in advance that such doctrine was false in principle and
ridiculous in detail, so conversely the followers of Panaetius found
it necessary expressly to repudiate the teaching of a large number
of Stoics<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. We have in fact here a sharp conflict between
the cultured and Platonizing Stoics on the one side, and the
general feeling of the school on the other. Cicero elsewhere
treats it as an accepted Stoic doctrine that ‘the wise man will
blurt things straight out<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>’; and the theory of ‘gentlemanly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
professions’ can never have appealed to any large social circle.
In the period of the principate we find the theory of ‘decorum,’
as a whole, abandoned. Seneca, personally as sensitive as Cicero
himself, recognises the absurdity of wasting time in hinting at a
plain meaning<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, nor does he limit his choice of illustration even
when addressing a lady of high social position<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. We must look
then in some other direction than the <i>de Officiis</i> for a duly proportioned
exposition of the Stoic virtue of Soberness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The appetites.</div>

<p id="section345"><b>345.</b> Reverting to the definitions of this virtue, we find,
amongst those that are generally accepted, first,
that it is ‘the science of things that are to be
sought or avoided or neither<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>’; secondly, that it is ‘concerned
with the human appetites<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.’ Now the term ‘appetite’ or ‘impulse’
(ὁρμή, <i>appetitus</i>) includes in the Stoic philosophy all those
first movements of the soul which draw us on towards some
object, and which are adumbrations of right conduct requiring
revision and control by reason. But it seems clear that Soberness
has little to do with those higher impulses that are
characteristic of man, such as the love of knowledge or of
society, since other virtues are concerned with these. It remains
that Soberness is the virtue which is concerned with the appetites
common to men and the lower animals, which we may
shortly call the ‘lower appetites’; they are, as we have already
stated, the desires of eating, drinking, and sexual union. It is
just in this sphere that Pleasure arises, in the sense in which
it is condemned by the Cynics and popular moralists<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. We may
therefore shortly define Soberness as a right disposition of soul
in relation to Pleasure. Its peculiar characteristic is that it is
in the main a negative virtue, displaying itself in abstinence from
indulgence<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Two views of Pleasure.</div>

<p id="section346"><b>346.</b> In order then rightly to understand the virtue of Soberness,
we need a clear idea of the attitude of the
Stoics towards Pleasure. Zeno, as we have seen,
whilst definitely placing Pleasure in the category of things
indifferent, had nevertheless allowed it to be understood that
it might be an advantage (προηγμένον), and the seeking after it
natural (κατὰ φύσιν)<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>; and this is stated to have been the
express teaching of Hecato, Apollodorus, and Chrysippus<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.
To other Stoics this appeared to be a disastrous concession
to Epicurean views. Cleanthes, who had scornfully described
the ideal of Epicurus by the picture of Pleasure enthroned as
queen, with the Virtues submissively attending as her handmaidens<a id="FNanchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>,
interpreted the word ‘indifferent’ more strictly; he
refused to admit that pleasure was ‘natural’ or possessed any
worth<a id="FNanchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. In this view he was supported by a great many Stoics,
and practically by Archedemus, when he said that pleasure was
natural but valueless, like the hairs under the armpit<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. Hence
followed the acceptable conclusion that no sensible man would
pay much attention to so trivial a matter<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. Thus the one word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
‘indifferent’ came to include two views which were substantially
opposed, the one inclining to the Academic standpoint, and the
other to Cynism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pleasure an aftergrowth, or an evil.</div>

<p id="section347"><b>347.</b> From this contradiction an escape was sought by
making a distinction. In one sense pleasure is an
affection of the body, namely a tickling (<i>titillatio</i>)
of organs of sense, most readily illustrated in
the eating of dainties. This kind of pleasure, even if it is
not an advantage naturally sought, yet has some likeness to
one; though it is not directly to be aimed at, yet it may be
welcomed when nature grants it to us as an extra<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. This new
view practically coincides with that of Aristotle, who calls
pleasure an ‘aftergrowth’ (ἐπιγέννημα, <i>accessio</i>), which of itself
follows on virtuous action, and is attached to it as the scent
to a flower<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. But much more commonly, in ethical discussions,
‘pleasure’ denotes the excitement which is more strictly termed
‘hilarity’ (ἔπαρσις, <i>sublatio animi</i>), and is the unhealthy condition
of the soul when it is unduly attracted to an object of
choice<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. For this mischief Cicero suggests the Latin term <i>laetitia</i>,
which is perhaps not altogether adequate<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. This ‘pleasure’
may be unreservedly condemned as not merely indifferent, but
actually contrary to nature<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>; whilst the virtuous and natural
disposition is that of the man who not only contemplates toil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
and pain with calm mind, but actually welcomes them as possible
stepping-stones towards his own true advantage<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Active soberness.</div>

<p id="section348"><b>348.</b> Although the prevailing tendency in Stoic teaching
is to consider Soberness as a negative virtue, and
as opposed to the perturbation of Hilarity, there is
not wanting some recognition of its positive side. For Soberness
also demands that there shall be a healthy activity of the soul
in matters such as eating, drinking, and the relations of sex;
abstinence is not in itself an end, and if pursued out of season
is both a folly and a fault. But this point of view is not adequately
treated by any Stoic writer. Panaetius in discussing
daily duties omitted to consider the proper care of the body,
as was afterwards noticed by Antipater of Tyre; and Cicero
gets little further than a general recommendation of common
sense and self-restraint in all the circumstances of life<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. The
Romans of the principate were disposed to leave the matter
to the physician, suggesting only that food should suffice to
allay hunger, drink to put an end to thirst, and clothing to keep
away cold<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>; but it is probable that popular moral discourses
stopped short of this, and favoured some amount of endurance
as a discipline for the soul<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sober love.</div>

<p id="section349"><b>349.</b> With regard to the relations of sex, the Socratic
tradition was favourable to a more positive treatment.
Accordingly the Stoics (not without some
feeling that they are adopting a paradoxical position) assert
that love (ἔρως, <i>amor</i>) is an essential, both for the maintenance
of the State<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and for the character of the good man. Zeno<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
had laid it down that ‘the wise man will love<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.’ We must,
however, make a sharp distinction between love as the desire
of sexual union, and the higher Love (ἐρωτικὴ ἀρετή) which is
defined anew as ‘an effort to make friends suggested by a
beautiful object<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.’ Upon this impulse, which is natural in
the widest sense, is based friendship in the young, and the
more lasting tie between husband and wife. By imposing self-restraint
on the man, and inviting the woman to share the lessons
of philosophy, the Stoics introduced a new relation between
husband and wife based upon equality and comradeship<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. A
notable precedent was furnished by the Cynic community, when
the witty and learned Hipparchia joined Crates in the life of
the beggar-preacher<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; and Roman Stoicism supplies us with
numerous instances of the same companionship<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. Under such
conditions marriage is no longer a matter of free choice; it is
a civic duty incumbent on the young Stoic. The Stoics of the
Roman principate well perceived the danger that threatened
the society in which they lived through the growing practice
of celibacy<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of marriage.</div>

<p id="section350"><b>350.</b> The Stoic attitude towards marriage is well illustrated
by the following extract from a discourse by Antipater
of Tarsus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘A youth of good family and noble soul, who has a sense of social duty,
will feel that no life and no household is complete without wife and child. He
will also bear in mind his duty towards the State, for how can that be maintained
unless, as the fathers decay and fall away like the leaves of a fine
tree, the sons marry in the flower of their age, and leave behind them fresh
shoots to adorn the city, thereby providing for its protection against its
enemies? He will look upon marriage also as a duty towards the gods;
for if the family dies out, who will perform the accustomed sacrifices?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>Besides this he who knows nothing of wife and child has not tasted
the truest joys of affection. For other friendships are like platefuls of
beans or other like mixtures of juxtaposition, but the union of man and
wife is like the mixing of wine and water, or any other case of penetration
(κρᾶσις δι’ ὅλων); for they are united not only by the ties of substance
and soul and the dearest bond of children, but also in body. Other alliances
are for occasion, this is bound up with the whole purpose of life, so that the
parents on each side gladly allow that the wife should be first in her husband’s
affection, and the husband in his wife’s.</p>

<p>But in these days of dissolution and anarchy all things change for the
worse and marriage is thought a hard thing; and men call the celibate life
divine because it gives opportunity for licentiousness and varied pleasures,
and they bar the door against a wife as against an enemy. Others have
their fancy taken by beauty or dowry, and no longer look for a wife who is
piously brought up and obedient and a good manager; nor do they trouble
to instruct their wives in these matters. But if a man would attend to the
warnings of philosophers, of all burdens a lawful wife would be the lightest
and sweetest. Such a man would have four eyes instead of two, and four
hands instead of two, to supply all his needs: and if he desired leisure to
write books or take part in politics, he could hand over the whole business
of housekeeping to his partner<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages sought.</div>

<p id="section351"><b>351.</b> The four cardinal virtues, however widely they are interpreted,
do not exhaust the field of daily duties.
All objects that are ‘advantages’ (προηγμένα) are
<i>prima facie</i> such that the good man aims at securing them;
although if sufficient reason appears, he will entirely forego
them. The advantages of the soul, good natural disposition,
‘art,’ and ‘progress’ are discussed elsewhere in this chapter; as
advantages of the body are reckoned life, health, strength, good
digestion, good proportions, and beauty; whilst external advantages
are wealth, reputation, noble birth, and the like<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. In all
the details there is a lack of exactitude and of agreement amongst
the teachers. According to Seneca, men may reasonably wish
for tallness<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, and there is a kind of beauty (not dependent on
youth) of which women may be proud without blame<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. Fine
clothes make no one the better man, but a certain degree of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
neatness and cleanliness in dress is an advantage<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. For nobility
the Stoics have little regard; all men are derived through an
equal number of degrees from the same divine origin; virtue
is the true nobility<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. Good name (δόξα, <i>gloria</i>) is commonly
reckoned amongst ‘advantages’<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>; but Chrysippus and Diogenes
are said to have taught that a good man need not move a finger
for the sake of reputation, unless some advantage can be
obtained by it. Later teachers, influenced (as we are told) by
the criticisms of Carneades, made it absolutely plain that they
reckoned good name (apart from anything attainable by it) as
an advantage, and they even considered it natural that a man
should think of posthumous reputation<a id="FNanchor_1689" href="#Footnote_1689" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. The general feeling
of the school seems to be that the approval of others is too
uncertain to be a fitting aim; its place is taken by the approval
of ‘conscience.’ This term, which originally expressed the
burden of a guilty secret, became in the Roman period modified
in meaning, and could thus express the approval awarded to a
man by his inner and personal consciousness, even when all the
world disapproves his acts: this self-approval is closely akin to
peace of mind<a id="FNanchor_1690" href="#Footnote_1690" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wealth.</div>

<p id="section352"><b>352.</b> On no subject would it be easier to find apparently
contradictory views amongst Stoic writers than on
that of wealth. To decry wealth and praise poverty
is to some extent a commonplace with all the philosophical
schools; and with Seneca in particular this was so frequent a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
practice<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> that his hearers found some inconsistency between
his words and his deeds; for he was, as is well known, a rich
man. But the position of the school is clear. ‘Riches are not
a good’ is a Stoic paradox, emphasized in a hundred forms, and
by every teacher<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>; but nevertheless they are an ‘advantage,’
and thus are rightly aimed at by the good man<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. To the
wealthy Stoics generally, and to the Romans of the republican
period especially, the maintenance of the family property (<i>res
familiaris</i>) was a duty of high importance; and the wasting of
it in wholesale largess, a serious misdeed<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. The Stoic view
was sufficiently summed up in a proverb borrowed from Epicurus
or one of his followers: ‘he who feels the need of wealth
least, can make the best use of it<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.’ Although Panaetius did
not write a special chapter on the acquisition and use of
wealth<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, yet his views on the latter point are made sufficiently
plain in his treatment of the virtue of Justice<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. The justification
of wealth lies in the intention to use it well, and this
was a favourite subject with Hecato of Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. As to its
acquisition and investment, Cicero is content to refer us to the
high-principled men who conduct the financial affairs of the
capital<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberty.</div>

<p id="section353"><b>353.</b> Amongst those popular terms which hold an ambiguous
place in the Stoic philosophy we must reckon
‘liberty’ (ἐλευθερία, <i>libertas</i>). In one sense liberty
is a condition of soul such as characterizes the free-born citizen
in contrast to the slave; this liberty differs but little from the
virtue of Greatness of Soul already described<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, and in its full
meaning is a good, which the wise man alone can possess<a id="FNanchor_1701" href="#Footnote_1701" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.
But in another sense liberty is an external advantage, sometimes
defined as ‘the power of living as you wish<a id="FNanchor_1702" href="#Footnote_1702" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>,’ and as such eagerly
desired by the slave; more often perhaps it is conceived as ‘the
right of saying what you please<a id="FNanchor_1703" href="#Footnote_1703" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.’ In this sense liberty is
equivalent to the παῤῥησία which was the watchword of the
democracy of Athens, and was the equally cherished privilege
of the nobility of Rome<a id="FNanchor_1704" href="#Footnote_1704" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>; in a slightly different sense it was
the boast of the Cynic missionary. The Stoics take a middle
position; whilst all recognise that some sort of liberty is a
precious privilege<a id="FNanchor_1705" href="#Footnote_1705" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, and are prepared on occasion to sacrifice
life or position for its sake<a id="FNanchor_1706" href="#Footnote_1706" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, there are not wanting voices to remind
us that it is unreasonable to speak out one’s mind without
regard to persons or circumstances<a id="FNanchor_1707" href="#Footnote_1707" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>, that the wrath of tyrants
ought not lightly to be provoked<a id="FNanchor_1708" href="#Footnote_1708" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, and that the most terrible
of all oppressors is the soul that has lost its self-control<a id="FNanchor_1709" href="#Footnote_1709" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disadvantages.</div>

<p id="section354"><b>354.</b> Just as virtue chooses advantages in accordance with
natural laws, so it refuses disadvantages in accordance
with a disinclination (ἔκκλισις, <i>alienatio</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
which is equally natural and right so long as it is controlled
by reason<a id="FNanchor_1710" href="#Footnote_1710" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. Since to every advantage there is opposed a
corresponding disadvantage, to choose the one is necessarily
to refuse the other; and the doctrine of ‘reasonable refusal’ is
that of reasonable choice in its negative form. It will therefore
be sufficient to give a formal statement of the theory. Disadvantages,
or things that have negative value (ἀπαξία), may be
subdivided according as they are disadvantages in themselves,
as an ungainly figure; or as they bring about other disadvantages,
as shortness of ready money; or for both reasons, as bad
memory or ill-health<a id="FNanchor_1711" href="#Footnote_1711" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. They may also be subdivided into three
classes, according as they affect the soul, the body, or things
external. Disadvantages of the soul are such things as inborn
vulgarity or dulness of wit; of the body, ill-health, and dulness
of the organs of sensation; of external things, poverty, loss of
children, and the contempt of our neighbours<a id="FNanchor_1712" href="#Footnote_1712" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Healthy affections.</div>

<p id="section355"><b>355.</b> Since the virtues are permanent dispositions (διαθέσεις)
of the soul, rooted in firm principles in which the
wise man never wavers, but to which none else can
attain, some other name is required to describe those more
passing but yet wholesome moods which stand in contrast with
the evil ‘affections’ or perturbations of the soul which will be
discussed in our next chapter. A beginning is made in this
direction with the three ‘good affections’ (εὐπάθειαι, <i>constantiae</i>,
<i>sapientis affectiones</i>). Here a new use of terms is introduced.
Strictly speaking an ‘affection’ is an evil state of soul; but as
we have no corresponding word for a good and calm condition,
the use of the word ‘affection’ is extended in this direction<a id="FNanchor_1713" href="#Footnote_1713" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.
Each of these ‘good affections’ is introduced to us in contrast
with a perturbation to which it bears a superficial resemblance.
Thus contrasted with Fear is ‘Caution’ (εὐλάβεια, <i>cautio</i>), which
is right avoidance, and is entirely consistent with Courage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
rightly understood. Subdivisions of Caution are (i) ‘Shame’
(αἰδώς, <i>verecundia</i>), the avoidance of deserved blame, and
(ii) ‘Sanctity’ (ἁγνεία) the avoidance of offences against the
gods<a id="FNanchor_1714" href="#Footnote_1714" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. Contrasted with Greed is ‘Readiness’ (βούλησις, <i>voluntas</i>),
the reasonable stretching out after future advantages<a id="FNanchor_1715" href="#Footnote_1715" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>;
contrasted with Hilarity is Joy (χαρά, <i>gaudium</i>), the reasonable
appreciation of present advantages<a id="FNanchor_1716" href="#Footnote_1716" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. Both Readiness and Joy
are entirely consistent with Soberness rightly understood. To
the perturbation of Grief no good affection is named as bearing
any resemblance; but we need not for that reason question but
that the wise man may entertain some quiet form of sympathy
for the troubles of others, and of regret for the blows which
fortune deals to him in political disappointment or personal
bereavement<a id="FNanchor_1717" href="#Footnote_1717" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<p>The ‘good affections’ are possessed by the wise man only<a id="FNanchor_1718" href="#Footnote_1718" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>;
but not all wise men possess them, nor any at all times<a id="FNanchor_1719" href="#Footnote_1719" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>. On
the other hand it is a daily duty to approximate to them, so
that on this ground the good citizen enters into competition with
the wise man on not altogether uneven terms<a id="FNanchor_1720" href="#Footnote_1720" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. The whole
doctrine of ‘good affections’ may be conceived as an answer
to those who accuse the Stoic of lack of feeling<a id="FNanchor_1721" href="#Footnote_1721" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>; for the much
derided ‘apathy’ of the school is substituted the doctrine of
‘eupathy.’ Wisdom is not to be compared to the surface of
a frozen sea, but to that of a rippling river. The lectures of
Musonius and Epictetus bring out on every point the meaning
of ‘eupathy’ in its various applications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The ethical motive.</div>

<p id="section356"><b>356.</b> We have now sketched the Stoic system of daily duties
in its main features, and this sketch will be made
more complete in many particulars in the course
of the next two chapters. To the modern reader the question
here suggests itself—what compelling force has this system?
what motive is supplied to the ordinary man for thus planning
out his life? To this question the ancient philosophers did
not directly address themselves; nevertheless their answers are
implied in their teaching as a whole. Thus the Stoics would
doubtless reply, first, that daily duties are prescribed to us by
reason<a id="FNanchor_1722" href="#Footnote_1722" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>; not perhaps always by reason in its highest sense,
to which we must not appeal in every individual action, but at
least by the spirit of reasonableness (εὐλογιστία). Secondly,
that the common opinion of mankind, growing daily stronger,
recommends them; they are, as we have seen from the beginning,
things that it comes in our way to do, that every good
citizen and good man will be sure to do. As to future rewards
and punishments, though these are not excluded by Stoicism,
they are certainly never pressed as motives for right living.
But the strongest of all motives is undoubtedly the mental
picture of the wise man, the vision of that which is ‘absolutely
good.’ Critics may urge: ‘it is a picture that never has been
or will be realized in men’s lives, a vision of that which is very
far off and which you will never see or touch.’ This the Stoics
hardly care to deny, but the difficulty does not disturb them.
The vision attracts by its own beauty, the hope of attainment
is cherished by all but the worst<a id="FNanchor_1723" href="#Footnote_1723" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. We have spoken of the
‘ordinary man,’ or, as the Stoics put it, of ‘us who are not wise
men.’ But, strictly speaking, there is no room for the ordinary
man in the system, but only for the ‘probationer’ (προκόπτων,
<i>proficiens</i>). It remains for us to trace the upward path from daily
duty to virtue, along which every good man is endeavouring to
advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progress.</div>

<p id="section357"><b>357.</b> The doctrine of progress (προκοπή, <i>progressio</i>) is not
peculiar to Stoicism, but it is nevertheless an
essential feature of it<a id="FNanchor_1724" href="#Footnote_1724" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. Critics may indeed dispute
as to whether virtue has ever been in practice attained;
but the Stoic must hold fast to the ethical principles that
‘virtue can be taught<a id="FNanchor_1725" href="#Footnote_1725" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>’ and that ‘virtue is an art<a id="FNanchor_1726" href="#Footnote_1726" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.’ Every
man has from birth a capacity for acquiring virtue<a id="FNanchor_1727" href="#Footnote_1727" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>, which
varies in degree according to his natural disposition of soul<a id="FNanchor_1728" href="#Footnote_1728" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>;
on this foundation every man builds by concurrent learning
and practice<a id="FNanchor_1729" href="#Footnote_1729" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. The child is greatly helped if he possesses
the trait of ‘modesty’ (αἰδώς, <i>verecundia</i>), which is essentially
a readiness to defer to others and to learn from those who are
older and wiser<a id="FNanchor_1730" href="#Footnote_1730" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>; though later it may turn to ‘false shame,’
which is a hindrance<a id="FNanchor_1731" href="#Footnote_1731" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. He will then learn to understand and
perform his daily duties; and as his character ripens, this performance
will daily become easier and more pleasurable to
him<a id="FNanchor_1732" href="#Footnote_1732" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>, more certain and more steady in itself. And now daily
duties come near to Right Actions, which are indeed daily duties
perfected (τέλειον καθῆκον, <i>perfectum officium</i>), and complete in
every point<a id="FNanchor_1733" href="#Footnote_1733" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. In order to rise to this higher standard the good
man must first perform his duty in all particulars<a id="FNanchor_1734" href="#Footnote_1734" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>; he must do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
so with regularity and in harmony with the order of nature<a id="FNanchor_1735" href="#Footnote_1735" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>;
he will then need only a certain fixity, conviction, and stability
to pass into the ranks of the wise<a id="FNanchor_1736" href="#Footnote_1736" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversion.</div>

<p id="section358"><b>358.</b> The stages of progress are variously expounded by
Stoic writers<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>; but on one principle all are agreed.
Progress is not a half-way stage between vice and
virtue, as the Peripatetics teach<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>; it is a long preparation, to be
followed by a change sudden and complete (μεταβολή, <i>conversio</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1739" href="#Footnote_1739" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.
The final step, by which a foolish man becomes in
an instant wise, is different in kind to all that have gone before.
This position is a necessary consequence of the doctrine that
‘the good is not constituted by addition<a id="FNanchor_1740" href="#Footnote_1740" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>,’ and is enforced by
various illustrations. The probationer is like a man who has
long been under water; little by little he rises to the surface,
but all in a moment he finds himself able to breathe. He is
like a puppy in whom the organ of sight has been for days
past developing; all at once he gains the power of vision<a id="FNanchor_1741" href="#Footnote_1741" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.
Just so when progress reaches the end there dawns upon the
eyes of the soul the complete and dazzling vision of the good,
of which till now only shadows and reflections have been perceived.
For a moment he is wise, but does not even yet realize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
his own wisdom; then again in a moment he passes on to the
complete fruition of happiness<a id="FNanchor_1742" href="#Footnote_1742" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duty.</div>

<p id="section359"><b>359.</b> Thus from the lowlier conception of ‘daily duties’ we
have again climbed upwards to the supreme ethical
end, to absolute goodness, which is Virtue in her
full royalty and the Universal Law (κοινὸς νόμος) as it appeals
to the individual man. In this connexion the ideal is familiar
in modern times under the name of Duty. The ancient Stoics
perhaps never quite reached to any such complete formulation
of their ethical theory in a single word; but their general
meaning is perfectly expressed by it. Just as the Socratic
paradoxes mark the quarrel of philosophy with outworn
ideas expressed in conventional language, so its reconciliation
with the general opinion is marked by those newly-coined terms
such as ‘conscience’ and ‘affection’ which are now familiar
household words. We cannot indeed demonstrate that ‘Duty
exists,’ any more than we can that deity or providence exists;
but we may well say that without it ethical discussion would
in our own day be hardly possible. The following stanzas from
Wordsworth’s ‘Ode to Duty,’ based upon a Stoic text<a id="FNanchor_1743" href="#Footnote_1743" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>, may be
a useful reminder, not only of the dominant position of this conception
in modern thought, but also of the continued tendency
of the human mind to express its supreme convictions in
anthropomorphic language.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1660" href="#FNanchor_1660" class="label">[92]</a> See above, § <a href="#section319">319</a>. It does not seem possible to accept Pearson’s view (on Z. fr.
128) that Zeno intended πόνος to be the προηγμένον, and ἡδονή the ἀποπροηγμένον;
but both he and his successors undoubtedly recognised the value of πόνος (toil) as
a discipline. The following remarks communicated to the writer by Mr Pearson throw
much light on a really difficult question. ‘Even the Cynics are forced to admit that not
all “pleasure” is to be condemned (the evidence is in Zeller’s <i>Socratics</i>, p. 308), but
the only form of it which deserves consideration is that which is the result and after-effect
of πόνος. In other words, it may be argued that true pleasure is the cessation
of pain (Plat. <i>Phileb.</i> 44 <span class="allsmcap">B</span>). The glorification of Heracles the toilsome hero corresponds;
but pleasure as understood by the vulgar is unhesitatingly to be rejected.
Zeno was the inheritor of all this, and, if he ever said that ἡδονή was προηγμένον, his
remark can only have applied to the ἀπονία-ἡδονή; and such certainly was the view
of Chrysippus (Plut. <i>Sto. rep.</i> 30, 2).’ In the passage here referred to from Plutarch
ἀπονία takes the place of ἡδονή as a προηγμένον; so also in Stob. ii 7, 7 e and Cic.

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sin.</div>

<p id="section360"><b>360.</b> The Stoic view of the universe is coloured by optimism.
All comes from God, all works towards
good. None the less the Stoic morals are stern.
Men in the mass are both foolish and wicked; they defy God’s
will and thwart his purpose. The world is full of sin, and all
sins (to use the Socratic paradox) are equal. What then is sin?
It is a missing of the mark at which virtue aims (ἁμάρτημα); it
is a stumbling on the road (<i>peccatum</i>); it is a transgressing of
the boundary line<a id="FNanchor_1745" href="#Footnote_1745" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. It is the child of ignorance, the outward
expression of ill health of the soul. Everywhere and in every
man it weakens, hampers, and delays the work of virtue. It
cannot however finally triumph, for it is at war with itself.
The Persians were wrong when they conceived an Evil Power,
a concentration of all the powers of mischief in one personality.
This cannot be, for sin lacks essential unity. It destroys but
does not build; it scatters but it does not sow. It is an earth-born
giant, whose unwieldy limbs will in the end be prostrated
by a combatant, small to the outward view, but inspired with
divine forcefulness. If we understand what sin is, we shall see
its repulsiveness; if we learn how it spreads, we shall seek protection
against its infecting poison; if we attack it in detail, in
individual men and in their daily acts, we shall in the end lay it
low. Philosophy then proceeds to arm itself for its task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The four sinful conditions are errors.</div>

<p id="section361"><b>361.</b> Sin is ignorance; more accurately, it is that which
appears to be knowledge, but is not knowledge;
it is false judgment. If we follow the process by
which knowledge is attained, we find that there
is no error in the mind-picture (<i>visum</i>), whether it is sensory
or partly sensory and partly rational; this is an adumbration
automatically presented to the mind. But ‘assent is in our
power’; it is both an intellectual and a moral act. A too hasty
assent to that which appears to be but is not is both an error
and an offence; and most particularly so when it lies in the
application of the general conceptions (προλήψεις) of ‘good’
and ‘evil’ to particular cases<a id="FNanchor_1746" href="#Footnote_1746" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. In this way we quickly reach
four sinful conditions, which come about by mistaking things
indifferent, that is, advantages and disadvantages, for things
good or evil. These are:</p>

<p>(i) Fear (φόβος, <i>metus</i>), in which a future disadvantage is
mistaken for a future evil;</p>

<p>(ii) Greed (ἐπιθυμία, <i>libido</i>), in which a future advantage is
mistaken for a future good;</p>

<p>(iii) Grief (λύπη, <i>aegritudo</i>), in which a present disadvantage
is mistaken for a present evil;</p>

<p>(iv) Hilarity (ἡδονή, <i>laetitia</i>), in which a present advantage is
mistaken for a present good<a id="FNanchor_1747" href="#Footnote_1747" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of the last two evils the title presents difficulty in
all languages; thus for Grief we might substitute any term such
as Discontent, Vexation, Worry or Fretfulness; it is a lack of
Courage in bearing pain or disappointment. Again for Hilarity
we might substitute Elation, Exaltation, Excitement: it is a lack
of Soberness in the moment of pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They are also maladies.</div>

<p id="section362"><b>362.</b> From another point of view all sin is due to a lack of
moral force, a want of tone in the moral sinews, an
unhealthy condition of the soul<a id="FNanchor_1748" href="#Footnote_1748" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Ultimately this
point of view agrees with that just described: for it is the lack
of health and strength which leads to hasty and ill-judged
assent<a id="FNanchor_1749" href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. But for practical purposes we may use this distinction
to lead up to a difference of grade. Thus we may associate
ignorance with that rooted perversity of mind which is the
exact opposite of virtue, and which is therefore in the strictest
sense ‘vice’ (κακία, <i>vitium</i>)<a href="#Footnote_1749" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; and want of tone with a passing
condition which we cannot deny to be an evil, but may
nevertheless describe by the gentler terms ‘perturbation’ and
‘affection<a id="FNanchor_1750" href="#Footnote_1750" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.’ Such an evil is a disturbance of the soul’s calm,
an ‘infection’ of its health. It may exist in three grades to
be hereafter described, as a ‘ruffling,’ a ‘disturbance,’ a ‘disease’;
and in both the latter forms it must be rooted out, for in both
grades it is an evil, and in the last it is a vice which threatens
to poison the man’s whole nature. Hence we reach the Stoic
paradox that ‘the affections must be extirpated<a id="FNanchor_1751" href="#Footnote_1751" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.’ But although
this is our only ethical standard, we are not debarred from
suggesting remedies which may alleviate the malady in particular
persons and under special circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fear.</div>

<p id="section363"><b>363.</b> The evil of Fear (φόβος, <i>formido</i>, <i>metus</i>) is practically
opposed to the virtue of Courage. Here philosophy
builds upon the foundations of common opinion,
and its task is the easier. The youth who is brought up not
to regard suffering, poverty, exile, or death as evils, will never
be afraid. Since it is death that most alarms mankind by its
grim aspect, he who can face this giant without trembling will
not know fear, or at the most will only feel a slight ruffling of
the soul. In asserting that ‘fear should be rooted out’ the
Stoics cross no general sentiment; the tradition of the heroic
age is the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Greed.</div>

<p id="section364"><b>364.</b> The treatment of Greed (ἐπιθυμία, <i>libido</i>) is similar.
This fault is opposed to the Soberness with which
men should aim at advantages; and when we have
determined the standard of Soberness every transgression of it
reveals Greed. But under this heading the Stoics include the
vices of Anger<a id="FNanchor_1752" href="#Footnote_1752" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Cruelty, for which the heroic age had no
condemnation. In regard to the former they come into conflict
with the Peripatetics also, who maintain that Anger serves useful
ends, and should be controlled, not extirpated<a id="FNanchor_1753" href="#Footnote_1753" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. The consideration
of this condition of mind will therefore bring out the
divergence between the two schools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anger.</div>

<p id="section365"><b>365.</b> The Peripatetics assign Anger to the passionate part
of the soul (τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν); they admit that it
needs to be restrained by reason, but hold that
within proper limits it is both natural and necessary. In war
it is essential to heroic action; he who is filled with it despises
danger, and rushes on to great achievements<a id="FNanchor_1754" href="#Footnote_1754" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. It is no less
necessary in peace, in order that the wicked may not go unpunished<a id="FNanchor_1755" href="#Footnote_1755" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
Aristotle says compendiously that ‘anger is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
spur of virtue<a id="FNanchor_1756" href="#Footnote_1756" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,’ the armour of the man of high soul. To this
point of view the Stoics are opposed alike on the ground of
principle and of experience. We do not need disease as a
means to health<a id="FNanchor_1757" href="#Footnote_1757" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, or armour which sways instead of being
swayed<a id="FNanchor_1758" href="#Footnote_1758" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. A good man will face danger unmoved, from the
sense of duty; and will face it more firmly and more perseveringly
than he whose passions are excited<a id="FNanchor_1759" href="#Footnote_1759" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. He will punish
wrong-doers either for their amendment or for the protection
of others, without being angry with them<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. Fabius the Delayer
conquered his own spirit before he overcame Hannibal<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; and
the very gladiators strike, not when their feelings move them,
but when the opportunity has come<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Degrees of anger; remedies for it.</div>

<p id="section366"><b>366.</b> Anger is technically defined as ‘the greedy desire of
avenging an injury,’ or (more precisely) as ‘the
greedy desire to punish one whom you deem to
have injured you unjustly<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.’ That it is a temporary madness
has always been held by the wise<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; and this is indicated by the
appearance of the angry, the threatening look, the heightened
colour, the gnashing teeth, the stamp of the foot<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; also by the
fact that children are specially prone to anger, even for frivolous
causes<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, and that anger is often directed against harmless persons
or objects<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. Nevertheless anger does not consist of a merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
instinctive feeling, but implies the assent of the will<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; so that
we can always trace the three stages, first the appearance of
an injury done (<i>species oblata iniuriae</i>), secondly the assent
(<i>animus adsentit atque adprobat</i>), thirdly the outbreak of anger
(<i>sequitur ira</i>)<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. To check anger the first necessity
is time<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>: reflection will often show us that we have
not been injured at all, or not so much as we supposed<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Then
it is well to put ourselves in the place of the offender, and try to
look at the offence from his point of view<a id="FNanchor_1772" href="#Footnote_1772" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. Where anger has
become a disease (<i>iracundia</i>), more violent remedies must be used;
some have been cured by looking at themselves in a mirror<a id="FNanchor_1773" href="#Footnote_1773" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>;
others must apply the ‘contrary twist<a id="FNanchor_1774" href="#Footnote_1774" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>,’ and learn when struck
to turn quietly away<a id="FNanchor_1775" href="#Footnote_1775" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variations of anger.</div>

<p id="section367"><b>367.</b> Anger is an evil that has many varieties, and the precisians
exercise their ingenuity in distinguishing the
bitter-humoured (<i>amarus</i>), the fiery (<i>stomachosus</i>),
the fierce (<i>rabiosus</i>), the man who is hard to get on with (<i>difficilis</i>),
and many other shades of character. But one variety
deserves special notice, because the evil disposition exists though
its expression is checked. The angry man of this type does not
allow himself to go beyond complaint and criticism, but he nurses
his feeling in the depths of his heart<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. He would on no account
express himself in loud outcries, but his displeasure is easily
excited and persistent. This evil we call moroseness; it is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
feeling characteristic of a decadent society<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, and (like all other
kinds of anger) it calls for unsparing repression.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cruelty.</div>

<p id="section368"><b>368.</b> Cruelty, a tendency to excess in punishment<a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, is an evil
constantly attendant upon the possession of power,
and directly opposed to the virtue of clemency.
Roman history has exhibited many examples of it, beginning
with Sulla who ordered seven thousand Roman citizens to be
slain on one day<a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, continuing with the many masters who are
hated for cruelty to their slaves<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. It cuts at the root of the
ties of humanity and degrades man to the level of the beast<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>;
in its extreme form it becomes a madness, when the slaying of
a man is in itself a pleasure<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. As a remedy for cruelty in its
milder forms it is well to consider the true objects of punishment;
first, to reform the offender; secondly, to make others
better by a warning; thirdly, to give a sense of safety to the
community by removing offenders<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. All these objects are better
effected if punishment is moderate and rare, and appears to be
awarded with reluctance. When cruelty has become a disease
it is necessary to remind the tyrant that his manner of life is
a pitiable one<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, and that a complete cure can be worked by
putting him to death<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grief.</div>

<p id="section369"><b>369.</b> In reckoning Grief in its countless varieties as an evil
the Stoics did not altogether run counter to public
opinion. In the heroic age grief was indeed not
forbidden, but it was sharply limited; women might grieve, men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
should remember. But in prescribing the total extinction of this
state of mind the Stoics appeared to pass the bounds of human
nature; public feeling revolted against what seemed impossible
of attainment. Our position to-day is not greatly altered; but
we may notice that whereas in ordinary social life Grief is not
only tolerated but approved, yet in battle, earthquake, flood, and
pestilence our ideal of the hero is one which almost entirely excludes
the indulgence of this emotion.</p>

<p>Grief takes many forms, as Fretfulness, Disappointment,
Restlessness, Pity, and Mourning; we proceed to examine them
in order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fretfulness.</div>

<p id="section370"><b>370.</b> The simplest form of Grief is fretfulness under bodily
pain, the effect of depression of the soul and contraction
of its sinews<a id="FNanchor_1786" href="#Footnote_1786" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. In all ages and under all
philosophies the capacity of bearing pain without flinching is the
primary test of virtue; and in the Cynic and Stoic schools alike
the dogma ‘pain is no evil’ is of critical importance. In this
matter correct doctrine needs to be strengthened by life-long
discipline; but it is not required by Stoic principles that general
principles should be forced upon the acceptance of individual
sufferers. Panaetius therefore acted quite correctly when, in
writing to Quintus Tubero on the subject of the endurance of
pain, he abstained from pressing the usual paradox<a id="FNanchor_1787" href="#Footnote_1787" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. But all
who see this trial awaiting them will do well to consider how
much hardship men willingly endure for evil purposes, such as
those of lust, money-making, or glory. Cocks and quails will
fight to the death for victory: jugglers will risk their lives
swallowing swords, walking on tight ropes, or flying like birds,
when in each case a slip means death<a id="FNanchor_1788" href="#Footnote_1788" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. If we compose our
minds long before to meet suffering, we shall have more courage
when the time comes<a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Discipline of pain.</div>

<p id="section371"><b>371.</b> Still more effective is active training<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. Happy was the
Spartan youth who came to Cleanthes to ask him
whether pain was not a good; his education had
taught him that this was a more practical question than that
other, whether pain is an evil<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Recruits cry out at the slightest
wound, and are more afraid of the surgeon’s touch than of the
sword; on the other hand veterans watch the life-blood draining
away without a sigh<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. Some men groan at a box on the ear,
whilst others smile under the scourge<a id="FNanchor_1793" href="#Footnote_1793" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. Inexperience therefore
is the chief cause for weakness under pain; familiarity with it
brings strength<a id="FNanchor_1794" href="#Footnote_1794" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disappointed ambition.</div>

<p id="section372"><b>372.</b> The Grief that gives way to pain of mind has very
various forms; but that which is due to disappointed
ambition is perhaps the most typical.
Even men who had overcome the fear of death were known to
shudder at the bitterness of soul (<i>aegritudo animi</i>) which accompanies
defeat in a contested election (<i>repulsa</i>) in a republic, or
displacement from the favour of the powerful under a monarchy<a id="FNanchor_1795" href="#Footnote_1795" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.
For this malady the complete remedy is found in the paradox
that ‘the wise man is king,’ that virtue can never be unseated
from the curule chair<a id="FNanchor_1796" href="#Footnote_1796" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; temporary alleviations may be found,
even by philosophers, in biting sarcasms aimed at the incapacity
of one’s fellow-citizens<a id="FNanchor_1797" href="#Footnote_1797" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. It may be in the abstract the duty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
a good man to take part in politics; but experience shows that
the State has yet to be discovered which can tolerate a sage, or
which a sage can tolerate<a id="FNanchor_1798" href="#Footnote_1798" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Hence we find even Stoic teachers
relapsing into practical Epicureanism, and bidding their followers
to let the community go hang, and to reserve their energies for
some nobler occupation<a id="FNanchor_1799" href="#Footnote_1799" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. To these lapses from sound principle
we need not attach any serious importance; the individual Stoic
did not always live up to his creed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Restlessness.</div>

<p id="section373"><b>373.</b> Restlessness is grief of mind without known cause;
the unquiet soul rushes hither and thither, vainly
seeking to be free from its own company<a id="FNanchor_1800" href="#Footnote_1800" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. The
lesson that Horace had pressed a century earlier, that disquiet
can only be cured by quiet, has not been learnt<a id="FNanchor_1801" href="#Footnote_1801" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. In Homer
Achilles tosses on his bed in fever, lying first on his face, then
on his back, never long at rest in any position; and so to-day
our wealthy man first travels to luxurious Campania, then to
the primitive district of the Bruttii; north and south are tried
in turn, and alike disapproved, whilst after all the fault is not
in the place, but in the man<a id="FNanchor_1802" href="#Footnote_1802" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. In this temper men come to
hate leisure and complain that they have nothing to do<a id="FNanchor_1803" href="#Footnote_1803" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. This
folly reaches an extreme when men trust themselves to the sea,
take the chance of death without burial, and place themselves
in positions in which human skill may avail nothing<a id="FNanchor_1804" href="#Footnote_1804" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. It even
leads to great political disasters, as when Xerxes attacks Greece
because he is weary of Asia, and Alexander invades India because
the known world is too small for him<a id="FNanchor_1805" href="#Footnote_1805" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. The times will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
come, when men will seek novelty by travelling through the air
or under the sea; they will force their way through the cold of
the poles and the damp heat of the forests of Africa. The remedy
lies either in humbler submission to the will of the deity, or in
a sense of humour which sees the absurdity of taking so much
trouble for so little advantage<a id="FNanchor_1806" href="#Footnote_1806" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pity.</div>

<p id="section374"><b>374.</b> Pity is that weakness of a feeble mind, which causes it
to collapse at the sight of another man’s troubles<a id="FNanchor_1807" href="#Footnote_1807" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>,
wrongly believing them to be evils. Pity looks at
the result, not at the cause, and it is most keenly felt by women
of all ages, who are distressed by the tears even of the most
abandoned criminals, and would gladly burst open the doors of
the gaols to release them<a id="FNanchor_1808" href="#Footnote_1808" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The cause of pity lies in a too rapid
assent; we are caught napping by every sight that strikes on our
senses. If we see a man weeping, we say ‘he is undone’: if we
see a poor man, we say ‘he is wretched; he has nothing to eat<a id="FNanchor_1809" href="#Footnote_1809" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.’
Now we Stoics have a bad name, as though we recommended to
governors a system of harsh punishments<a id="FNanchor_1810" href="#Footnote_1810" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; but, on the contrary,
none value more highly than we the royal virtue of clemency<a id="FNanchor_1811" href="#Footnote_1811" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.
Only let it be considered that a wise man must keep a calm and
untroubled mind, if only that he may be ready to give prompt
help to those who need it; a saving hand to the shipwrecked,
shelter to the exile, the dead body of her son to a mother’s tears.
The wise man will not pity, but help<a id="FNanchor_1812" href="#Footnote_1812" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sensibility.</div>

<p id="section375"><b>375.</b> Nearly akin to the evil of pity is that sensitiveness to
the sufferings of others which leads men, contrary
reason, to turn the other way and avoid the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
sight of them. Of this weakness Epictetus gives us a lively
picture:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘When he was visited by one of the magistrates, Epictetus inquired of
him about several particulars, and asked if he had children and a wife.
The man replied that he had; and Epictetus inquired further, how he felt
under the circumstances. ‘Miserable,’ the man said. Then Epictetus
asked ‘In what respect? For men do not marry and beget children in
order to be wretched, but rather to be happy.’ ‘But I,’ the man replied,
‘am so wretched about my children that lately, when my little daughter
was sick and was supposed to be in danger, I could not endure to stay
with her, but I left home till a person sent me news that she had recovered.’
‘Well then,’ said Epictetus, ‘do you think that you acted right?’
‘I acted naturally,’ the man replied; ‘this is the case with all or at least
most fathers.’ ‘Let us be careful,’ said Epictetus, ‘to learn rightly the
criterion of things according to nature. Does affection to those of your
family appear to you to be according to nature and to be good?’ Certainly.’
‘Is then that which is consistent with reason in contradiction
with affection?’ ‘I think not.’ ‘Well then, to leave your sick child and
to go away is not reasonable, and I suppose that you will not say that it
is; but it remains to inquire if it is consistent with affection.’ ‘Yes, let
us consider.’ ‘Has the mother no affection for her child?’ ‘Certainly
she has.’ ‘Ought then the mother to have left her, or ought she not?’
‘She ought not.’ ‘And the nurse, does she love her?’ ‘She does.’
‘Ought then she also to have left her?’ ‘By no means.’ ‘But if this is
so, it results that your behaviour was not at all an affectionate act<a id="FNanchor_1813" href="#Footnote_1813" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Seneca draws for us the same picture of sentimental neglect
of duty. ‘Of our luxurious rich,’ he says, ‘no one sits by the
side of his dying friend, no one watches the death of his own
father, or joins in the last act of respect to the remains of any
member of his family<a id="FNanchor_1814" href="#Footnote_1814" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sensitiveness.</div>

<p id="section376"><b>376.</b> Another form of the evil of Grief is that of undue
sensitiveness to criticism and abuse. This mental
weakness is illustrated by the case of Fidus Cornelius,
who burst into tears because some one in the senate
called him a ‘plucked ostrich’; and in an earlier period Chrysippus
had been acquainted with a man who lost his temper
merely because he was called a ‘sea-calf<a id="FNanchor_1815" href="#Footnote_1815" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.’ Others are annoyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
by seeing their eccentricities imitated, or by reference to their
poverty or old age. The remedy for all these things is humour;
no one can be laughed at who turns the laugh against himself<a id="FNanchor_1816" href="#Footnote_1816" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.
Another is to cease thinking about oneself<a id="FNanchor_1817" href="#Footnote_1817" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mourning.</div>

<p id="section377"><b>377.</b> The hardest to bear of all distresses is the loss of
friends by death, and most particularly, the loss
by parents of their children. To meet this trouble
a special class of literature, called <i>consolationes</i>, grew up, not
confined to any one school of philosophers. The treatise of
Crantor the Academic was famous in Cicero’s time<a id="FNanchor_1818" href="#Footnote_1818" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; and in
the letter of Servius Sulpicius to Cicero upon his daughter’s
death we have an admirable example of the ‘consolation’ in
private correspondence<a id="FNanchor_1819" href="#Footnote_1819" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Sulpicius bids Cicero think of all
the grief and trouble in the world, the loss of political liberty
at Rome, the destruction of so many famous cities of antiquity,
until he feels that man is born to sorrow, and that his own loss
is but a drop in the ocean of the world’s suffering. He also calls
on the mourner to think of his own character, and to set an
example of firmness to his household<a id="FNanchor_1820" href="#Footnote_1820" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>. Cicero found his real
comfort in none of these things, but in industrious authorship.
We have unfortunately no example of a ‘Consolation’ by Musonius.
Seneca has left us two treatises in this style, one a
formal document addressed to the minister Polybius on the
death of his brother, the other a more personal appeal to Marcia,
a lady of an ‘old Roman’ family, on the death of a son. Besides
the arguments already used by Sulpicius<a id="FNanchor_1821" href="#Footnote_1821" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, he recommends to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
Polybius attention to the public service and the reading of
Homer and Virgil<a id="FNanchor_1822" href="#Footnote_1822" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. Both to him and to Marcia he pictures
the happiness of the soul now admitted to the company of the
blest<a id="FNanchor_1823" href="#Footnote_1823" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, or at any rate at peace and freed from all the pains of
life<a id="FNanchor_1824" href="#Footnote_1824" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. In writing to Marcia he recalls with effect the examples
of Octavia the sister, and Livia the wife of Augustus, each of
whom lost a promising son in early manhood. Octavia gave
herself up to her grief, never allowed her dead son to be mentioned
in her presence, and wore mourning to the day of her
death, though she was surrounded by her children and grandchildren.
Livia, after paying the last tokens of respect, laid
aside her grief, recalled with pleasure her son’s achievements,
and (advised so to act by her philosopher Areius) devoted herself
to her social duties, refusing to make all Rome sad because

<div class="sidenote">Resignation.</div>

<p id="section378"><b>378.</b> The consolations of Epictetus include less philosophical
speculation, and more religious resignation. To
begin with, preparation should be made for the
loss of children. Parental affection should not pass the bounds
of reason; every time that a father embraces his child, he should
reflect ‘this child is only lent to me,’ ‘this child is mortal<a id="FNanchor_1826" href="#Footnote_1826" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.’ If
the child dies, his first thought should be ‘he who has given
takes away<a id="FNanchor_1827" href="#Footnote_1827" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.’ To others he will say ‘I have restored the child<a id="FNanchor_1828" href="#Footnote_1828" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.’
His abiding mood will be that of resignation to the divine will.
He will realize that in the course of a long life many and various
things must happen; and that it is impossible to live to old age,
without seeing the death of many whom we love<a id="FNanchor_1829" href="#Footnote_1829" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comfort.</div>

<p id="section379"><b>379.</b> All ‘consolations’ aim at diminishing the grief of
mourners, nature being inclined rather to excess
than to defect in this matter. But the Stoics could
not altogether avoid the direct issue whether or not grief is a sin,
and weeping a weakness. The plain teaching of the school was
that ‘death is no evil,’ and therefore that grief for the dead is
against reason. And to this view the teachers give from time
to time formal adhesion, as being the better cause<a id="FNanchor_1830" href="#Footnote_1830" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. But in
individual cases they find that to a certain extent there is not
only excuse, but justification, for grief and tears; and thus they
come into touch with the common feelings of humanity<a id="FNanchor_1831" href="#Footnote_1831" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, whilst
the plea of ‘natural necessity’ serves to ward off the criticism
of sterner philosophers<a id="FNanchor_1832" href="#Footnote_1832" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. From this concession emerges in the
Roman period the definite precept of a time-limit for grief<a id="FNanchor_1833" href="#Footnote_1833" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>;
and its undue continuance is sternly denounced as due to love
of ostentation<a id="FNanchor_1834" href="#Footnote_1834" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, and the morbid enjoyment of sorrow by an ill-balanced
mind<a id="FNanchor_1835" href="#Footnote_1835" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>. Grief in this shape is a dangerous disease;
there must be no trifling with it, but it must be totally destroyed<a id="FNanchor_1836" href="#Footnote_1836" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Misanthropy.</div>

<p id="section380"><b>380.</b> Lastly, we include under the heading of Grief a weakness
which often developes into serious disease; that
general discontent, which is voiced in complaints
as to the wickedness of the age<a id="FNanchor_1837" href="#Footnote_1837" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and the degeneracy of young
Rome. Such discontent has always been characteristic of the
old<a id="FNanchor_1838" href="#Footnote_1838" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>; but under the principate it has developed into a special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
evil, the ‘hatred of the human race’ (<i>odium generis humani</i>).
Of this fault even philosophers may be suspected; for it must
be admitted that men are bad, have been bad, and always will be
bad<a id="FNanchor_1839" href="#Footnote_1839" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>; in short, that the whole human race is made up of madmen<a id="FNanchor_1840" href="#Footnote_1840" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.
But wise men will bear with this fact quietly and with a
smile<a id="FNanchor_1841" href="#Footnote_1841" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. It is futile to bring accusations against the whole race<a id="FNanchor_1842" href="#Footnote_1842" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>,
and a delusion to think our own times worse than those of our
predecessors. The old Romans, to whom we look up as models
of virtue, made just the same complaints of their own times;
and as a matter of fact the standard of general morality never
varies greatly from its average, either in an upward or a downward
direction<a id="FNanchor_1843" href="#Footnote_1843" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eating.</div>

<p id="section381"><b>381.</b> The fault of Hilarity (ἄλογος ἔπαρσις, <i>elatio animi</i>) is a
departure from Soberness and cheerful Joy with
regard to the things that appeal to our appetites,
and this in the direction of excess. With regard to food, it
corresponds to ‘greediness’ in modern speech. The matter is
but little discussed, but we have two interesting lectures by
Musonius, which are chiefly concerned with this vice, from which
we take the following extracts:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Greediness’ is an unpleasant fault, making men to resemble pigs and
dogs: but on the other hand healthy eating requires much supervision
and practice (ἐπιμέλεια καὶ ἄσκησις). Of all pleasures that tempt men,
greediness is the hardest to contend against; for it assails us twice every
day. To eat too much is wrong; to eat too fast is wrong; so it is also
to take too much pleasure in food, to prefer the sweet to the wholesome,
or not to give your companions a fair share. Another fault is to let
meals interfere with business. In all these points we should look chiefly
to health. Now we observe that those who use the simplest foods are
generally the strongest; servants are stronger than their masters, countryfolk
than townsmen, the poor than the rich. There is therefore good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
reason to prefer cheap food to that which is costly, and that which is
ready to hand to that which is only obtained with great trouble. Further,
some foods are more congenial than others to men’s nature; as those
which grow from the earth, or can be obtained from animals without
killing them. Food that requires no cooking has an advantage, as ripe
fruit, some vegetables, milk, cheese, and honey. Flesh food is for many
reasons objectionable. It is heavy and impedes thought; the exhalations
from it are turbid and overshadow the soul. Men should imitate the
gods, who feed on the light exhalations of earth and water. But to-day
we have even worse corruptions. Many men are dainty and cannot eat
food without vinegar or some other seasoning. Also we call in art and
machinery to aid our pleasures, and actually have books written on
cookery. All this may serve to titillate the palate, but is mischievous to
health<a id="FNanchor_1844" href="#Footnote_1844" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>The sarcasms of Seneca are aimed not so much against excess
in quantity or fastidiousness in quality, as against the collection
of dainties from all parts of the world<a id="FNanchor_1845" href="#Footnote_1845" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drinking.</div>

<p id="section382"><b>382.</b> As to drinking, the Stoic period marks a great change
in feeling. In the times of Zeno, hard drinking had
almost the honour of a religious ceremony; and the
banquet (συμπόσιον) was the occasion of many a philosophical
discussion. Zeno began by laying it down as a principle that
‘the wise man will not be drunken<a id="FNanchor_1846" href="#Footnote_1846" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>,’ and Chrysippus went so
far as to name drunkenness as causing the loss of virtue<a id="FNanchor_1847" href="#Footnote_1847" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. But
the prohibition was carefully guarded. The earlier teachers
permitted ‘wininess<a id="FNanchor_1848" href="#Footnote_1848" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>’; and Seneca justifies this means of
banishing care, pointing out many instances of public men of
drinking habits who discharged their duties admirably<a id="FNanchor_1849" href="#Footnote_1849" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
on the whole he inclines to a stricter view, finding that ‘drunkenness
is a voluntary madness,’ and that it removes that sense of
shame which most hinders men from wrongdoing<a id="FNanchor_1850" href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. Meanwhile
a change in public taste, and perhaps the continual example of
Cynic missionaries, had produced a tide of feeling in favour
of simple living. The philosophical discussions sketched by
Cicero take place at all times of the day, but most usually in
the morning hours; they are never associated with riotous
banqueting, but if necessary the meal is cut short to make room
for the talk. Under the principate the fare is of the simplest;
Seneca himself was a vegetarian in his youth<a id="FNanchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>; his teacher
Attalus was well content with porridge and water, and found
an audience ready to approve his taste<a id="FNanchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sexual indulgence.</div>

<p id="section383"><b>383.</b> A similar but more profound change had taken place
at the same time in regard to sexual relations. In
the time of Socrates courtesans and boy-favourites
played a large part in social life; associated with the banquet,
they formed part of the accepted ideal of cultured enjoyment;
even moralists approved of them as providing a satisfaction to
natural desires and indirectly protecting the sanctity of the
home<a id="FNanchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. The same attitude of mind is shown by Seneca under
similar circumstances, when he recommends that princes be indulged
with mistresses in order to make their character more
gentle<a id="FNanchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. But little by little a more severe standard prevailed<a id="FNanchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.
From the first the Stoics set themselves against the pursuit of
other men’s wives<a id="FNanchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. With regard to other relations, they did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
not feel called upon to condemn them in other men<a id="FNanchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>; they
were indeed, in themselves, matters of indifference<a id="FNanchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>; but they
found it contrary to reason that a man’s thoughts should be
occupied with matters so low, or that he should bring himself
into subjection to irregular habits and become a slave to a
woman<a id="FNanchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. As the courtesan was gradually excluded by this
rule<a id="FNanchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, the general opinion fell back on the slave as the most
accessible and least dangerous object of indulgence<a id="FNanchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. But
the philosophers of the principate, following Zeno, who in these
matters took the πρέπον (<i>decorum</i>) as his rule<a id="FNanchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, find it in a high
degree unfitting that the master, who should in all things be a
model of self-control in his own household, should display so
grave a weakness to his slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chastity.</div>

<p id="section384"><b>384.</b> Thus little by little there emerged the ideal of a strict
chastity, to the principle of which not even the
marriage relation should form an exception<a id="FNanchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.
Every falling off from this ideal is sin or transgression<a id="FNanchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>; and
it is especially true in this matter that each act of weakness
leaves its trace on the character, and that he who yields becomes
a feebler man<a id="FNanchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. The Socratic paradox, that the wise man will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
be a lover<a id="FNanchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, is consistently maintained by the Stoics; but the
practical limitations of this doctrine are well illustrated by
the following striking passage from the lectures of the Stoic
Musonius:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Men who do not wish to be licentious and bad should consider that
sexual relations are only lawful in marriage, and for the begetting of
children; such as aim at mere pleasure are lawless, even in marriage.
Even apart from adultery and unnatural relations, all sexual connexions
are disgraceful; for what sober-minded man would think of consorting
with a courtesan, or with a free woman outside marriage? and least of
all would he do so with his own slave. The lawlessness and foulness of
such connexions is a disgrace to all who form them; as we may see that
any man who is capable of a blush does his utmost to conceal them. Yet
one argues: “in this case a man does no injustice; he does not wrong
his neighbour or deprive him of the hope of lawful issue.” I might reply
that every one who sins injures himself, for he makes himself a worse and
less honourable man. But at any rate he who gives way to foul pleasure
and enjoys himself like a hog is an intemperate man; and not least he
who consorts with his own slave-girl, a thing for which some people find
excuse. To all this there is a simple answer; how would such a man
approve of a mistress consorting with her own man-servant? Yet I presume
he does not think men inferior to women, or less able to restrain
their desires. If then men claim the supremacy over women, they must
show themselves superior in self-control. To conclude; sexual connexion
between a master and his female slave is nothing but licentiousness<a id="FNanchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">‘Bear and forbear.’</div>

<p id="section385"><b>385.</b> Thus our detailed study of the four perturbations has
led us to lay little stress on Fear and Greed, the
weaknesses of the heroic period when men’s minds
were actively turned to the future, and to concentrate our
attention on Grief and Hilarity, the two moods in which life’s
troubles and temptations are wrongly met with as they arrive.
As we follow the history of Stoic philosophy through the times
of the Roman principate, we find that this tendency to lay stress
on the training of the passive character increases: till Epictetus
tells us that of all the vices far the worst are ‘lack of endurance’
(<i>intolerantia</i>), which is the developed form of Grief, and ‘lack of
restraint’ (<i>incontinentia</i>), which is the persistent inclination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
towards Hilarity<a id="FNanchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. Hence the cure for vice is summed up by
him in the golden word, ‘bear and forbear<a id="FNanchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>’; that is, practise
Courage and cast off Grief, practise Soberness and keep Hilarity
far from you. ‘A good rule,’ a Peripatetic would reply, ‘for
women and slaves.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Avoidance of temptation.</div>

<p id="section386"><b>386.</b> This negative attitude is most strongly marked in
Epictetus in connexion with the dangers of sexual
passion. Thus his short advice to all young men
with regard to the attractions of women is ‘Flee at once<a id="FNanchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>’;
and even in this his advice was countenanced in advance by the
more tolerant Seneca<a id="FNanchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. It would appear from both writers that
the battle between the sexes had become unequal at this period,
so often is the picture drawn of the promising and well-educated
youth literally and hopelessly enslaved by a mistress presumably
without birth, education, or honour<a id="FNanchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. It causes us some surprise
to find that the distinction between heavenly and earthly
love<a id="FNanchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> is not brought in as a corrective of the latter. Only in a
general way the suggestion is made that seductive attractions
should be driven out by virtuous ideals:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Do not be hurried away by the appearance, but say: “Appearances,
wait for me a little; let me see who you are and what you are about;
let me put you to the test.” And do not allow the appearance to lead
you on and draw lively pictures of the things which will follow; for if
you do, it will carry you off wherever it pleases. But rather bring in to
oppose it some other beautiful and noble appearance and cast out this
base appearance. And if you are accustomed to be exercised in this way,
you will see what shoulders, what sinews, what strength you have.... This
is the true athlete.... Stay, wretch, do not be carried away. Great is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
combat, divine is the work; it is for kingship, for freedom, for happiness.
Remember God; call on him as a helper and protector<a id="FNanchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gradations of vice.</div>

<p id="section387"><b>387.</b> From the study of the separate evils we revert to the
general theory of Vice. And here we must recall
the point that so far as vice is weakness or ill-health
of the soul, it admits of gradations, which may conveniently be
stated as three, namely (i) rufflings of the soul; (ii) commotions,
infections, or illnesses; (iii) diseases or vices proper<a id="FNanchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. It is not
quite easy to classify the rufflings or first slight disturbances of
the soul (<i>prima agitatio animi</i>) under the four perturbations; but
the bodily indications of them seem to be more marked in the
weaknesses of the active or heroic character, namely Fear and
Greed. Thus in the direction of Fear we meet with hair standing
on end—pallor of complexion—trembling limbs—palpitation,
and dizziness, all of which are bodily indications that fear is not
far off; in the direction of Anger (a form of Greed) we meet
with heightened colour, flashing eyes, and gnashing teeth<a id="FNanchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.
In the direction of Grief we meet with tears and sighs, and in
that of Hilarity the automatic sexual movements, amongst
which we must perhaps include blushing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rufflings.</div>

<p id="section388"><b>388.</b> It does not appear that the early Stoic masters occupied
themselves much with the gradations of vice;
although a text can be taken from Zeno for a
discourse on this subject. Neither does the earnest and cynically-minded
Epictetus care to dwell on such details. On the
other hand Seneca lays the greatest possible stress on the
doctrine that ‘rufflings’ are not inconsistent with virtue. For
this two arguments are available, which are perhaps not quite
consistent. First, the bodily indications are beyond the control<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
of the mind; they are necessary consequences of the union of
body and soul, that is, of our mortal condition<a id="FNanchor_1877" href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. Secondly, the
‘rufflings’ correspond to the mind-pictures presented to the soul
in thought, and therefore are neither moral nor immoral until the
soul has given its assent to them<a id="FNanchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. From either point of view
we arrive at a result congenial to this philosopher. The wise
man is, in fact, subject to slight touches of such feelings as grief
and fear<a id="FNanchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>; he is a man, not a stone. Secondly, the sovereignty
of the will remains unimpaired; give the mind but time to collect
its forces, and it will restrain these feelings within their proper
limits<a id="FNanchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. The doctrine is in reality, though not in form, a
concession to the Peripatetic standpoint; it provides also a convenient
means of defence against the mockers who observe that
professors of philosophy often exhibit the outward signs of moral
weakness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Commotions.’</div>

<p id="section389"><b>389.</b> If the soul gives way to any unreasoning impulse, it
makes a false judgment and suffers relaxation of
its tone: there takes place a ‘commotion’ or ‘perturbation’
(πάθος, <i>affectus</i>, <i>perturbatio</i>), which is a moral evil<a id="FNanchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.
The Greek word πάθος admits of two interpretations; it may
mean a passive state or a disease; we here use it in the milder
sense. By an ‘emotion’ we mean that the soul is uprooted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
from its foundation, and begins as it were to toss on the sea;
by ‘affection’ that it is seized or infected by some unwholesome
condition<a id="FNanchor_1882" href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; by ‘perturbation’ that it has ceased to be an orderly
whole, and is falling into confusion. When we regard these
words in their true sense, and shake off the associations they
carry with them in English, it is clear that all of them denote
moral evils; nevertheless they cannot rightly be called ‘diseases’
of the soul<a id="FNanchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. The evils and weaknesses which have been discussed
are commonly displayed in ‘commotions’ or ‘perturbations,’
and are normally equivalent to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diseases of the soul.</div>

<p id="section390"><b>390.</b> The soul by giving way to perturbations becomes
worse; it acquires habits of weakness in particular
directions. This weakness from a passing disposition
(ἕξις) changes into a permanent disposition or habit
(διάθεσις), and this is in the full sense a ‘disease’ of the soul<a id="FNanchor_1884" href="#Footnote_1884" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.
These diseases or vices are, strictly speaking, four in number<a id="FNanchor_1885" href="#Footnote_1885" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>:
but the Stoics run into great detail as regards their titles and
subdivisions. Diseases in the ordinary sense (ἀρρωστήματα)
display restlessness and want of self-control; such are ambition,
avarice, greediness, drunkenness, running after women<a id="FNanchor_1886" href="#Footnote_1886" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, passionate
temper, obstinacy, and anxiety. An opposite class
of maladies consists of unreasonable dislikes (κατὰ προσκοπὴν
γινόμενα, <i>offensiones</i>); such are inhospitality, misogynism, and
quarrelling with the world in general<a id="FNanchor_1887" href="#Footnote_1887" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Men are good or bad.</div>

<p id="section391"><b>391.</b> The study of vice in its various forms and gradations
leaves untouched the main positions of Stoic ethics,
including the Socratic paradoxes. Men are of two
classes only, the wise and the foolish, the good and the bad<a id="FNanchor_1888" href="#Footnote_1888" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.
This bold dualism the Stoics hold in common with the Persians<a id="FNanchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>;
and though it is on the one hand tempered so as to meet
the common opinion that most men are of middling character,
and on the other hand subordinated to the monistic principle
that good shall in the end prevail, it remains the key-stone of
this department of philosophy. Virtue is a right state of mind;
everything that falls short of it is therefore a wrong state of
mind. Virtue and vice lie in the inward disposition, not in the
outward act<a id="FNanchor_1890" href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>; and one who has crossed the line is equally out
of bounds whatever the distance to which he has travelled on
the far side<a id="FNanchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. Each man has therefore an all-important choice
to make. The great Stoic teachers were filled with a yearning
after righteousness and reconciliation with the divine purpose
and a disgust and horror of the condition of the man who
is at variance with his Creator, his neighbour, and himself<a id="FNanchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.
These convictions they encased as usual in paradoxes and
syllogisms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All sins are equal.</div>

<p id="section392"><b>392.</b> That ‘the affections must be extirpated<a id="FNanchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>’ ceases to be
a paradox, as soon as we have defined affections as
states of mind contrary to reason, and have made
room for the ‘reasonable affections’ of caution, good will, and
joy<a id="FNanchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. That ‘all sins are equal<a id="FNanchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>’ remains still, as of old, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
stumbling block<a id="FNanchor_1896" href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. Yet this Socratic paradox has a simple
interpretation; it is a protest against the light-heartedness
which tolerates ‘petty’ acts of wrongdoing, and is indifferent
to the evil habits of mind thus acquired<a id="FNanchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>. Two of the Stoic
teachers of the transition period, Heraclides of Tarsus and
Athenodorus, are said to have abandoned the paradox<a id="FNanchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>, and
all Stoics were ready to admit that sins are ‘unlike’<a id="FNanchor_1899" href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. But,
as usual, the main body held firmly to a doctrine in which
they had discovered a real practical value. Just the same
principle is expressed by other paradoxes, as that ‘he who
has one vice has all, though he may not be equally inclined
to all<a id="FNanchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>’; and again that ‘he who is not wise is a fool and
a madman<a id="FNanchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sin is curable.</div>

<p id="section393"><b>393.</b> In spite of the parallelism of virtue and vice the
latter is destined to subordination, not only in
the history of the universe, but also in the individual
man. Even if sins are equal, vice as ill health of the
soul has degrees. The first ‘rufflings’ of the soul are, as we
have seen, not to be reckoned as real evils; its ‘perturbations’
give the hope of a coming calm; and grievous though its
‘diseases’ are, we have no suggestion of incurable sin, or of
the hopeless offender. Even he who has most fallen retains
the germs of virtue, and these may again ripen under a proper
discipline<a id="FNanchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoic austerity.</div>

<p id="section394"><b>394.</b> The attitude of the Stoic school towards sin and
weakness exposed it, as we have seen, to constant
criticism and ridicule. To some extent this was
due to the profession of philosophy in itself: for every such
profession implied some claim to clearer knowledge and more
consistent action than that of the crowd<a id="FNanchor_1903" href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. But the Stoics
also sought to be ‘austere’ with regard to social pleasures, and
thus it seemed that they neither offered others a share in their
own happiness nor sympathetically partook in that of others<a id="FNanchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>;
whilst at the same time they claimed exemption from the
weaknesses and failings of their neighbours. We have seen
both Seneca and Epictetus anxious to meet criticism on these
points by laying stress on those touches of natural feeling in
which wise and foolish alike share. But in addressing the
members of the sect their tone is very different; they hold
out, as a prize worth the winning, the prospect of attaining
to that calm and unchanging disposition of mind which has
for ever left behind the flutterings of fear and greed, of grief
and hilarity, and which is attuned to reason alone<a id="FNanchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. Epictetus
indeed often expresses elation and pride upon this theme:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I will show the sinews of a philosopher. What are these? A desire
(ὄρεξις) never disappointed, an aversion (ἔκκλισις) which never meets with

(πρόθεσις), an assent which is not rash. These you shall see<a id="FNanchor_1906" href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘Men, if you will attend to me, wherever you are, whatever you are
doing, you will not feel sorrow, nor anger, nor compulsion, nor hindrance,
but you will pass your time without perturbations and free from everything.

should he be able to proclaim it?) but by God through reason, is he not
content when he reflects—Now no evil can happen to me<a id="FNanchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>?’</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1749" href="#FNanchor_1749" class="label">[5]</a> In this sense there are four vices, each the precise opposite of one of the virtues;
they are ἀφροσύνη (<i>insipientia</i>), ἀδικία (<i>iniustitia</i>), δειλία (<i>ignavia</i>) and ἀκολασία
(<i>intemperantia</i>); and each of these is rooted in a fixed perverse judgment, so that

to vice is evil. The Roman writers realized the difficulty in the use of words: ‘morbi
autem et aegrotationes partes sunt vitiositatis; sed perturbationes sintne eiusdem
partes quaestio est. vitia enim adfectiones sunt manentes, perturbationes autem

<div class="sidenote">Precepts.</div>

<p id="section395"><b>395.</b> We have now set forth the Stoic theory of ethics,
both in its high philosophic framework and in its
more detailed treatment, in which it prescribes
what is to be done and what to be left undone, and how the soul
is to be disciplined in health and medicined in sickness. It
remains for us to study the application of the system to individual
cases, a matter which perhaps lies outside the scope of philosophy
as understood at the present day, but is an essential part of the
work of churches and social organizations. This department of
philosophy was termed by the ancients ‘precepts,’ or (more
fully) ‘advice, dissuasion, admonition, exhortation, consolation,
warnings, praise, reproof’ and so forth<a id="FNanchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; by some philosophers,
as for instance by Aristo of Chios, it was held in contempt, by
others (less inclined to Cynism) it was considered alone worthy
of pursuit<a id="FNanchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. But the steady conviction of the main body of Stoic
teachers was that theory and precept must go hand in hand<a id="FNanchor_1910" href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;
that moral principles have no strength apart from their daily
application<a id="FNanchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and that practical suggestions apart from a sound
and reasoned system are like leaves cut from the bough, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
lasting greenness<a id="FNanchor_1912" href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Since precepts apply directly to individual
persons and particular circumstances, they presuppose some
relationship between teacher and hearer<a id="FNanchor_1913" href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; the latter must be
either a convert to the school or one who has grown up under its
influence. In the Roman period the department of precepts is
of increasing importance; we have something to learn from
Antipater, Panaetius and Cicero, but we find much more material
in the lectures (διατριβαί, ‘diatribes’) and letters of Musonius,
Seneca, Epictetus and other teachers of the period of the principate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Training of the young.</div>

<p id="section396"><b>396.</b> The ‘precepts’ which we find illustrated by our various
authorities are not easily systematized, but they
have all the more the charm of personal intimacy;
through them we are admitted to the home life of the Stoics.
As Seneca wrote to Lucilius, so every day did Stoic fathers,
Stoic teachers, Stoic jurists, address those who came within
their influence. Believing every man to have the seed of
virtue in him, they had confidence that by their words it would
often be stirred to life<a id="FNanchor_1914" href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; and that in other cases, in which the
promising shoot had become overshadowed by ignorance or evil
habits, it would by the same means begin to grow again<a id="FNanchor_1915" href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. But
the full benefits of precepts could only be seen where they fell on
well-prepared ground, and formed part of a training extending
from infancy to the grave; where the instructor could daily
ensure their enforcement and observe their effect. This opportunity
was necessarily found most often in the teaching of the
young; and the Stoic system of precepts, though not restricted
to one period of life, was to a large extent a foreshadowing of a
‘Theory of Education.’ It was under all circumstances guided
by the rule of ‘little by little.’ Precepts must be few<a id="FNanchor_1916" href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, and must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
be in themselves easy for the individual to carry out<a id="FNanchor_1917" href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; but by
steady practice great things will be accomplished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The teacher’s example.</div>

<p id="section397"><b>397.</b> Since the value of precepts depends on the personal
influence of the instructor, it is clear that his
example will be of the greatest importance, and we
may first ask what the discipline is to which he himself
submits. Here the Cynic teacher seems to have the advantage,
for he lives in the sight of all men; and the Indian,
who allows himself to be scorched or burnt to show his contempt
for pain, makes a still more forcible appeal<a id="FNanchor_1918" href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. The Stoic does
not parade himself in this fashion, but neither does he lock the
door of his private life against any who wish to examine it<a id="FNanchor_1919" href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. In
the early morning he shakes off sleep, rousing himself to do the
day’s work of a man<a id="FNanchor_1920" href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Having clothed himself, he turns his
mind towards his Maker, and sings his praises; he resolves
during the coming day to cooperate in his purposes, and to bear
cheerfully any burden that may be placed upon him<a id="FNanchor_1921" href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. He will
then give a short time to gymnastic exercises for the good of his
health<a id="FNanchor_1922" href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; after which, if his strength allows it, he will take, winter
or summer, a plunge into the cold bath<a id="FNanchor_1923" href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; next comes the
slightest of meals<a id="FNanchor_1924" href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; then a short nap or reverie<a id="FNanchor_1925" href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. From this he
is aroused by the stir around him, and he then applies himself to
the day’s studies, being careful to alternate reading and writing,
so that his mind may be neither exhausted by the latter nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
relaxed by the former<a id="FNanchor_1926" href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Later on he will consider his practical
duties towards his relatives, his friends, and society in general.
He will order his household and settle the disputes of his
dependents. He will visit his friends, saying a word here and
there in season<a id="FNanchor_1927" href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, but not (like the Cynics) to all and sundry<a id="FNanchor_1928" href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
He will encourage those who are making progress in virtue, and
sharply warn those who are in danger of a fall<a id="FNanchor_1929" href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. He advises a
young mother to nurse her child at her own breast; and when
he meets with objections, points out the wisdom and propriety
of obeying the prescriptions of nature<a id="FNanchor_1930" href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. Returning home, he
will again enjoy some slight bodily exercise, joining perhaps in
a game of ball; his thoughts however will not always turn on
success in the game, but he will consider how many principles
in physics and ethics may be illustrated by it<a id="FNanchor_1931" href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. Now that
evening comes on, he sits down to a meal (not over-elaborate) in
the company of one or two favourite pupils<a id="FNanchor_1932" href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. Afterwards comes
the temptation to burn the midnight oil in gathering seeds of
wisdom for the morrow from the well-thumbed manuscript of
Cleanthes or, it may be, of Epicurus<a id="FNanchor_1933" href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. Retiring to his chamber,
he will examine his conscience, review the events of the past
day, and be at peace with himself before he sleeps<a id="FNanchor_1934" href="#Footnote_1934" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The child’s life.</div>

<p id="section398"><b>398.</b> With the training of children the Stoic teacher is
perhaps not altogether familiar, but he knows its
importance<a id="FNanchor_1935" href="#Footnote_1935" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; it must be based on simplicity and
austerity, for just at this time indulgence and luxury are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
most dangerous stimulants to the passions<a id="FNanchor_1936" href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. The child must
learn to eat and drink in a mannerly way<a id="FNanchor_1937" href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, to refrain from
loud talking and laughing<a id="FNanchor_1938" href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, to express himself in respectful
and graceful words<a id="FNanchor_1939" href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. He must be taught to do right before he
can understand the reason why<a id="FNanchor_1940" href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, or else by doing wrong he will
make it difficult for himself afterwards to do right; he must be
ruled until he can rule himself<a id="FNanchor_1941" href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. For this reason we give
children proverbs (<i>sententiae</i>) or anecdotes (χρεῖαι) to write out
and learn, such as ‘honesty is the best policy’ or ‘Socrates
being asked of what city he was ...’; and these short pithy sayings
sink deep<a id="FNanchor_1942" href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. But in the school life of children no attempt must
be made to grapple with the real problems of life, because these
are too hard for them, though parents often forget this objection<a id="FNanchor_1943" href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.
Games and amusements may be permitted; for though in
discussions on high principle the Stoics may be entirely opposed
to ‘relaxation of soul<a id="FNanchor_1944" href="#Footnote_1944" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>,’ yet in practical life they freely admit its
importance<a id="FNanchor_1945" href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. All dealings with children should be gentle; the
discipline of the rod has long ago been abandoned by all sensible
parents and teachers<a id="FNanchor_1946" href="#Footnote_1946" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Harm of soft living.</div>

<p id="section399"><b>399.</b> Soft living is at all ages to be avoided<a id="FNanchor_1947" href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. It is in these
days a danger to the bodily health; for when a
man is accustomed to be protected from a draught
by glass windows, to have his feet kept warm by foot-warmers
constantly renewed, and his dining-room kept at an even
temperature by hot air, the slightest breeze may put him
in danger of his life<a id="FNanchor_1948" href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. Those who envy men who ‘live
softly’ forget that their character becomes soft thereby<a id="FNanchor_1949" href="#Footnote_1949" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. In
particular clothing should not be such as altogether to protect
the body from heat in summer, and from cold in winter. It is
better to wear one shirt than two, best still to have only a coat.
Then again, if you can bear it, it is better to go without shoes;
for after all to be shod is not very different from being fettered,
and runners do not use shoes<a id="FNanchor_1950" href="#Footnote_1950" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. So also avoid luxurious furniture;
of what use is it that couches, tables and beds should be
made of costly woods, and adorned with silver and gold? We
eat, drink, and sleep better without these things. In all these
matters the Spartans set us a good example; for while disease
injures the body only, luxury corrupts both body and soul<a id="FNanchor_1951" href="#Footnote_1951" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Training of girls.</div>

<p id="section400"><b>400.</b> Boys and girls must be educated alike. This nature
teaches us, for we train colts and puppies without
any regard for the difference of sex. The true
education of children is in the practice of the virtues, and
these are the same for men and for women. Women need
Wisdom to understand the ordering of a household, Justice
to control the servants, Soberness that they may be modest and
unselfish. But they also need Courage; in spite of the name
‘manliness’ (ἀνδρεία), this is not a virtue reserved for men.
Without it women may be led by threats into immodest acts.
Females of all kinds fight to defend their young; the Amazons
too were good fighters, and it is only for want of practice that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
women cannot do the same to-day. That men, being the
stronger, should do the heavier work, and women the lighter, is
an arrangement which is often convenient, but circumstances
may require the contrary. Girls at any rate must learn equally
with boys to bear suffering, not to fear death, not to be in low
spirits about anything that happens; to avoid grasping habits,
to love equality and benevolence, and to do no harm to man or
woman<a id="FNanchor_1952" href="#Footnote_1952" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Obedience to parents.</div>

<p id="section401"><b>401.</b> Children should obey their parents, but in the spirit of
reason. We do not obey a father who gives orders
for the treatment of a sick person contrary to those
of the physician; nor one, who being himself ill, demands
things that are not good for him; nor one who bids his
son steal, or appropriate trust funds, or sacrifice his youthful
bloom. We do not even obey him when he tells us to spell
a word wrongly or strike a false note on the lyre. If your father
forbids you to philosophize, show him by your manner of life, by
prompt obedience, by good temper, by unselfishness, how good
a thing philosophy is. But after all, the command of the
universal Father is more urgent upon you; which is, to be just,
kind, benevolent, sober, high-souled; above labours and above
pleasures; pure from all envy and plotting. You need not
assume the outward appearance of a philosopher; for the power
of philosophy is in the innermost part of the soul, which the
father can no more reach than the tyrant<a id="FNanchor_1953" href="#Footnote_1953" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Example of gladiators and soldiers.</div>

<p id="section402"><b>402.</b> The fancy of young men is easily attracted by the
vision of virtue, but it is hard for them to persevere;
they are like soft cheese which slips away from the
hook by which it is taken up<a id="FNanchor_1954" href="#Footnote_1954" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. We must therefore
put before them an ideal which appeals to them, and in which
the advantages of fixed purpose and severe training are apparent
to the eye. Such is the training of the athlete, the gladiator,
and the soldier<a id="FNanchor_1955" href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. The teachers of wrestling bid the pupil try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
again after each fall<a id="FNanchor_1956" href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; the trained boxer is eager to challenge
the most formidable opponent<a id="FNanchor_1957" href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. The gladiator has learnt the
lesson that pain is no evil, when he stands up wounded before a
sympathetic crowd and makes a sign that it matters nothing<a id="FNanchor_1958" href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.
But most of all the soldier’s oath serves as an example, when he
pledges himself to serve Caesar faithfully all his life: let the
young philosopher pledge himself to serve his God as faithfully,
to submit to the changes and chances of human life, and to obey
willingly the command to act or to suffer<a id="FNanchor_1959" href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. Without effort, as

<p id="section403"><b>403.</b> In youth bad habits are apt to acquire some strength
before they can be rooted out, and it will be well
to anticipate this evil by exercising body and soul
in advance in a direction contrary to that of the most common
temptations. The teacher will therefore give to his precepts
an exaggerated character, reckoning upon human frailty to
bring about a proper standard in practice<a id="FNanchor_1961" href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Thus since
luxury is a chief enemy of virtue, the body should at least
occasionally be brought low. A practice approved by the
example of eminent men is to mark out from time to time
a few days for the exercise of the simple life; during this time
life is to be maintained on coarse bread and water, in rough
dress and all the surroundings of poverty<a id="FNanchor_1962" href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. Since Cynism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
is a ‘short cut to virtue<a id="FNanchor_1963" href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>,’ philosophers may well employ the
methods of Diogenes for short periods, as a corrective to any
tendency to excess; rich people do as much for love of
change<a id="FNanchor_1964" href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal appearance.</div>

<p id="section404"><b>404.</b> On the question of personal appearance there is much
to be said on both sides. Foppishness is a disagreeable
vice, and it is contemptible that a young
man should smell of perfumes. On the other hand a total
disregard of appearances is not approved by the Stoics; ‘it
is against nature’ says Seneca ‘to be averse to neatness in
appearance<a id="FNanchor_1965" href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.’ In these outward matters a sensible man will
conform to fashion, nor will he wish to make the name of
philosopher still more unpopular than it is<a id="FNanchor_1966" href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. The founders of
Stoicism laid it down that men and women should wear the
same dress; but the later teachers laid stress on the natural
distinction of the sexes; and to men the beard should be an
object of just pride, for it is more becoming than the cock’s
comb, or the lion’s mane<a id="FNanchor_1967" href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. This is to the Stoic a point of
honour; he should part with his head more readily than with his
beard<a id="FNanchor_1968" href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. But the beard may be trimmed; for, as Zeno has
observed, nature provides rather against the ‘too little’ than
against the ‘too much,’ and reason must come to her help.
Women do right to arrange their hair so as to make themselves
more beautiful; but for men any kind of artistic hair-dressing is
contemptible<a id="FNanchor_1969" href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p id="section405"><b>405.</b> The young should train themselves alternately to bear
solitude and to profit by society<a id="FNanchor_1970" href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>: since the wise
man is never dependent on his friends, though
none can take better advantage of them<a id="FNanchor_1971" href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. In living alone
a man follows the example of the deity, and comes to know
his own heart<a id="FNanchor_1972" href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. But solitude must not be a screen for secret
vices; a man only uses it rightly when he can without shame
picture the whole world watching his hours of privacy<a id="FNanchor_1973" href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. The
right choice of friends calls for true wisdom; for the soul
cannot but be soiled by bad company<a id="FNanchor_1974" href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. The only true friendship
is based on the mutual attraction of good folk<a id="FNanchor_1975" href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>; therefore
the wise are friends one to another even whilst they are
unacquainted<a id="FNanchor_1976" href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. It is well to consider much before choosing a
friend, but afterwards to give him implicit trust<a id="FNanchor_1977" href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; for a true
friend is a second self<a id="FNanchor_1978" href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Such friendship can only arise from
the desire to love and be loved<a id="FNanchor_1979" href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; those who seek friends for
their own advantage, will be abandoned by them in the day of
trial<a id="FNanchor_1980" href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. In the companionship of well-chosen friends there grows
up the ‘common sense,’ which is an instinctive contact with
humanity as a whole, making each man a partner in the thoughts
and needs of all around him. This feeling is a principal aim of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
philosophy<a id="FNanchor_1981" href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. But the young philosopher should make no
enemies; he should be free from that dislike of others which so
often causes a man to be disliked, and should remember that he
who is an enemy to-day may be a friend to-morrow<a id="FNanchor_1982" href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comradeship in marriage.</div>

<p id="section406"><b>406.</b> As the young Stoic passes from youth to manhood, he
will turn his mind towards marriage as a political
and social duty<a id="FNanchor_1983" href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; but if he is really touched by the
divine flame, he will also find in it that enlargement of his own
sympathies and opportunities of which the wise man is always
glad<a id="FNanchor_1984" href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. Under the Roman principate we observe a rapid development
of personal sympathy between husband and wife;
and though in society girls who attended philosophers’ classes
had an ill name as being self-willed and disputatious<a id="FNanchor_1985" href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, yet it is
from this very circle that the ideal of a perfect harmony of mind
and purpose was developed most fully. Musonius often speaks
on this subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Husband and wife enter upon a treaty to live and to earn together, and
to have all things in common, soul, body and property. Unlike the lower
animals, which mate at random, man cannot be content without perfect
community of thought and mutual affection. Marriage is for health and for
sickness alike, and each party will seek to outrun the other in love, not
seeking his own advantage, but that of his partner<a id="FNanchor_1986" href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘A man should look for a healthy body, of middle stature, capable of
hard work, and offering no attraction to the licentious. But the soul is far
more important; for as a crooked stick cannot be fitted with one that is
straight, so there can be no true agreement except between the good<a id="FNanchor_1987" href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Seneca is reticent as to marriage, but we have no reason to
doubt that his life with Paulina was typical of the best Stoic
marriages. Thus he excuses himself for taking more thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
for his health than a philosopher should, by saying that the
happiness of Paulina depends upon it. ‘Her life is wrapped up
in mine, for its sake I must take care of my own. What can
be more delightful than to be so dear to one’s wife, that for her
sake one becomes dearer to himself<a id="FNanchor_1988" href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>!’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Celibacy.</div>

<p id="section407"><b>407.</b> On the question of marriage Epictetus strikes a
contrary note, characteristic of his time, and of his
bias towards Cynic practice:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘In the present state of things, which is like that of an army placed in
battle order, is it not fit that the Cynic should without any distraction be
employed only on the ministration of God? To say nothing of other things,
a father must have a heating apparatus for bathing the baby; wool for his
wife when she is delivered, oil, a bed, a cup; and so the furniture of the
house is increased. Where then now is that king, who devotes himself to
the public interests,</p>

<p class="noindent">whose duty it is to look after others; to see who uses his wife well, who
uses her badly, who quarrels, who administers his family well, and who does
not? Consider what we are bringing the Cynic down to, how we are taking
his royalty from him<a id="FNanchor_1990" href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>!’</p>

</div>

<p>To this very definite conception of a celibate order of
philosophers, devoting themselves to the good of humanity and
entitled thereby to become the rulers of society, Musonius makes
the following reply in advance from the true Stoic standpoint:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Marriage was no hindrance to Pythagoras, Socrates or Crates; and who
were better philosophers than they? Since marriage is natural, philosophers
should set the example of it. Why else did the Creator separate the human
race into two divisions, making the honourable parts of the body distinct for
each, and implanting in each a yearning for the other, but that he wished
them to live together and to propagate the race? He who would destroy
marriage, destroys the family and the commonwealth. No relationship is so
essential or so intimate; friend does not agree so well with friend, nor does
a father feel so keenly separation from his son. And why should a philosopher
be different from other men? Only that which is unbecoming is a
hindrance to a philosopher; but by doing his daily duty as a man he will
become kindlier in disposition and more social in his thoughts<a id="FNanchor_1991" href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Means of livelihood.</div>

<p id="section408"><b>408.</b> The head of a household must have a means of living;
and therefore the making of money (χρηματισμός,
<i>cura rei familiaris</i>) comes within the range of
precepts. The Greek writers recognised three proper means of
livelihood; (i) from kingship, that is, to be either a king or a
king’s minister or general; (ii) from politics, that is, by acting
as a magistrate or a judge; (iii) from sophistry, that is, by
teaching philosophy to those who are wishing to learn<a id="FNanchor_1992" href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. To
each profession there are obvious objections; indeed the sharp
critic of Stoicism can see no reason why a wise man, who lacks
nothing, should trouble himself about money-making. Each of
the three professions named assumes the existence of men
willing to be guided by philosophy, and these are not easily
found. If pupils are taken, the question arises whether fees
should be paid in advance or not. Now it is certainly more
reasonable that a student should only pay if he profits by his
teaching; but on the other hand no one can absolutely promise
to make a man good in a year, and deferred payments are often
found unsatisfactory<a id="FNanchor_1993" href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. Under the Roman principate we hear
little of the professions connected with public life; but it is clear
that the teacher and the physician are held in special regard<a id="FNanchor_1994" href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.
Seneca has not the breadth of mind to respect the painter or the
sculptor, any more than the wrestler or the stage-engineer<a id="FNanchor_1995" href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.
Yet Chrysippus had suggested a bolder standpoint when he said
that ‘the wise man will turn three somersaults for a sufficient
fee<a id="FNanchor_1996" href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>’; and no rule can be laid down except that a man should
earn his own living without injuring his neighbour<a id="FNanchor_1997" href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Agriculture,
as a calling favourable both to health of body and to innocence
of soul, continued to be praised, but was seldom practised except
as an amusement<a id="FNanchor_1998" href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kingly duties.</div>

<p id="section409"><b>409.</b> For every profession philosophy has appropriate precepts,
beginning with the king. There came one
day to Musonius a king of Syria, for in those times
there were kings subject to the Roman empire. Musonius
addressed him thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘You ought to be a philosopher as much as I. Your wish is to protect
and benefit your fellow-men; to do that, you must know what is good and
what is evil. A king too must understand Justice; for wars and revolts
come about because men quarrel about their rights. Also he must show
Soberness and Courage, that he may be an example to his subjects<a id="FNanchor_1999" href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. The
ancients thought that a king should be a living law (νόμος ἔμψυχος), and an
imitator of Zeus. Only a good man can be a good king.’</p>

</div>

<p>The king was highly pleased, and asked him to name any
boon he would. ‘Abide by my words,’ said Musonius, ‘that
will be the best boon both for me and for you<a id="FNanchor_2000" href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.’</p>

<p>Two precepts in particular are addressed to kings. The
first, that they should encourage friends who will speak the
truth to them. Even Augustus Caesar needed this lesson;
bitterly as he lamented the deaths of Agrippa and Maecenas,
he would not have allowed them to speak frankly had they
lived<a id="FNanchor_2001" href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. The second, that they should practise clemency, following
the example of Julius Caesar, who destroyed the evidence
upon which he might have punished his enemies<a id="FNanchor_2002" href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. None does
this virtue better become than kings and rulers<a id="FNanchor_2003" href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Court life.</div>

<p id="section410"><b>410.</b> To the man of high rank it is natural to desire to
move in the society of the great and the powerful.
Epictetus gives us a striking description of the
man who desires to be on the list of the ‘Caesaris amici,’ which
he thinks to be a good, though experience shows that it is not
such.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Of whom shall we inquire? What more trustworthy witness have we
than this very man who is become Caesar’s friend? “Come forward and tell
us, when did you sleep more quietly, now or before you became Caesar’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
friend?” Immediately you hear the answer, “Stop, I entreat you, and do
not mock me; you know not what miseries I suffer, and sleep does not come
to me; but one comes and says, Caesar is already awake, he is now going
forth; then come troubles and cares.” “Well, and did you sup with more
pleasure, now or before?” Hear what he says about this also. He says
that if he is not invited, he is pained; and if he is invited, he sups like a
slave with his master, all the while being anxious that he does not say or do
anything foolish. As befits so great a man, Caesar’s friend, he is afraid that
he may lose his head. I can swear that no man is so stupid as not to
bewail his own misfortunes the nearer he is in friendship to Caesar<a id="FNanchor_2004" href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>It is exactly under these circumstances that a thorough
training in philosophy is of really practical value.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘When you are going in to any great personage, remember that another
also from above sees what is going on, and that you ought to please him
rather than that other. He then who sees from above asks you: “In the
schools what used you to say about exile and bonds and death and disgrace?”
“That they are things indifferent.” “And the end of life, what is it?” “To
follow thee.” “Do you say this now also?” “I do.” Then go in to the great
personage boldly and remember these things: and you will see what a youth
is who has studied these things, when he is among men who have not studied
them. I imagine that you will have such thoughts as these; “Why do we
make such great and so many preparations for nothing? Is this the thing
which is named power? All this is nothing<a id="FNanchor_2005" href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>.”’</p>

</div>

<p>Yet a wise man will never challenge the anger of the powerful;
he will turn aside from it, as a sailor from a storm<a id="FNanchor_2006" href="#Footnote_2006" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. The
virtuous affection of caution must be called in to help him, so
many are his dangers. An independence of look, a slight
raising of the voice, an outspoken expression, an appeal to
public opinion, even unsought popularity are enough to excite
suspicion<a id="FNanchor_2007" href="#Footnote_2007" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. Perhaps after all the poet may be the wisest, who
advises good men to stay away from court altogether, for it is a
place where there is no room for them<a id="FNanchor_2008" href="#Footnote_2008" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life in the city.</div>

<p id="section411"><b>411.</b> A common cause of moral corruption is the routine of
city life. Here fashion dictates a round of occupations
which are unnatural, but in which men and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>

each one of whom suggests some abandonment of principle<a id="FNanchor_2012" href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
In the clubs all the most worthless members of society foregather<a id="FNanchor_2013" href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>.
The baths, which were at one time simply constructed,
and for the purpose of cleanliness, are now instruments of luxury;
and the water is now so hot as to be better fitted for torture
than pleasure<a id="FNanchor_2014" href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. For the evening meal there must always be
some novelty discovered, even if it is only to begin with the
dessert and end with the eggs<a id="FNanchor_2015" href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>; even the order of the seasons
must be inverted, that roses may adorn the table in winter<a id="FNanchor_2016" href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.
Upon the ill-spent day follows a disorderly night, and a heavy
headache the next morning<a id="FNanchor_2017" href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. From the temptations of such a
life the adherent of Stoicism will gladly escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life in the country.</div>

<p id="section412"><b>412.</b> A more real happiness is reserved for the man who
gives up town life for that of the country. For it
is most natural to win sustenance from the earth,
which is our common mother, and liberally gives back many
times over what is entrusted to her; and it is more healthy to
live in the open than to be always sheltering in the shade. It
matters little whether one works on one’s own land or on that of
another; for many industrious men have prospered on hired
land. There is nothing disgraceful or unbecoming in any of the
work of the farm; to plant trees, to reap, to tend the vine, to
thrash out the corn, are all liberal occupations. Hesiod the
poet tended sheep, and this did not hinder him from telling the
story of the gods. And pasturage is (says Musonius) perhaps
the best of all occupations; for even farm work, if it is exhausting,
demands all the energies of the soul as well as of the body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
whereas whilst tending sheep a man has some time for philosophizing
also.</p>

<p>It is true that our young men to-day are too sensitive and
too refined to live a country life; but philosophy would be well
rid of these weaklings. A true lover of philosophy could find no
better discipline than to live with some wise and kindly man in
the country, associating with him in work and in relaxation, at
meals and in sleeping, and so ‘learning goodness,’ as Theognis
tells us to do, ‘from the good<a id="FNanchor_2018" href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The householder.</div>

<p id="section413"><b>413.</b> Within the household the head of it is a little king,
and needs to display the kingly virtues of Justice
and Soberness. In his dealings with the perverse
he must consider how far each man is capable of bearing the
truth<a id="FNanchor_2019" href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. Indeed, willingness to listen to reproof is no small
virtue; few words are best, so that the wrongdoer may be left as
far as possible to correct his own ways<a id="FNanchor_2020" href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. Punishment must be
reserved for extreme cases, and is always to be administered
with calmness; it is felt more keenly when it comes from a
merciful master<a id="FNanchor_2021" href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. Persistent kindness wins over even bad
men<a id="FNanchor_2022" href="#Footnote_2022" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. It is further the privilege of the head of a household to
distribute kindnesses to those below him. His wealth he must
regard as given him in trust; he is only the steward of it, and
must neither hoard nor waste; for he must give both a debit
and a credit account of all<a id="FNanchor_2023" href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. But if the right use of money
causes the possessor anxious thought, no trace of this should
appear to others; giving should be without hesitation, and as a
delight<a id="FNanchor_2024" href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. The good citizen will pay his taxes with special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
pleasure, because in his eyes the welfare of the community
stands higher than his own or that of his family<a id="FNanchor_2025" href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>; but he will
not refuse a kindness even to an enemy who is in need<a id="FNanchor_2026" href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>; and in
giving a farthing to a beggar, he will imply by his manner that
he is only paying what the other is entitled to as his fellow-man<a id="FNanchor_2027" href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.
In short, he will give as he would like to receive<a id="FNanchor_2028" href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>, and
with the feeling that the chief pleasure of ownership is to share
with another<a id="FNanchor_2029" href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment of slaves.</div>

<p id="section414"><b>414.</b> The good householder will associate on easy terms
with his slaves, remembering that they too are
men, made of flesh and blood as he is himself<a id="FNanchor_2030" href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.
It is however a difficult matter to decide whether a master
should dine with his slave. Men of the old Roman type find
this a disgraceful practice, but the philosopher should decide in
its favour<a id="FNanchor_2031" href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. We do not need to inquire into a man’s social
position, if his character is attractive<a id="FNanchor_2032" href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. Plato has well said
that we cannot find a king who is not descended from a slave,
or a slave who is not descended from a king<a id="FNanchor_2033" href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>; and in fact
many a Roman slave was far better educated than his master<a id="FNanchor_2034" href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.
Even if we do not suppose that Seneca’s rule was commonly
practised in great Roman houses, the suggestion itself throws a
pleasing light on the position of a Roman slave. But if the
master was thus called upon to ignore differences of social
position, as much might be expected of the slave. With him it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
was doubtless an instinct to prize liberty, ‘the power of living
as you like,’ as the dearest of possessions. Yet many a slave
who won this reward by years of faithful service found that
liberty delusive, and would have been wiser to stay in the home
where he was valued<a id="FNanchor_2035" href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

large families (πολυπαιδία). Statesmen have always
considered it best that the homes of citizens should
be crowded with children; and for this reason the laws forbid
abortion and the hindrance of conception; they demand fines
for childlessness, and pay honours to those who bring up large
families. Public opinion takes the same view; the father of
many children is honoured as he goes about the city, and how
charming is the sight of a mother surrounded by a swarm of
children<a id="FNanchor_2036" href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>! No religious procession is so imposing. For such
parents every one feels sympathy, and every one is prepared to
cooperate with them<a id="FNanchor_2037" href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. But nowadays even rich parents
refuse to rear all their children, so that the first-born may be
the richer. But it is better to have many brothers than few;
and a brother is a richer legacy than a fortune. A fortune
attracts enemies, but a brother helps to repel them<a id="FNanchor_2038" href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comfort in poverty.</div>

<p id="section416"><b>416.</b> We have now accompanied the man of mature years
in his duties and his temptations: philosophy has
also a word to speak with regard to his trials. It
is well indeed if he is convinced that the buffets of fortune are
no real evils; but this doctrine can be supplemented by other
consolations. Of the most bitter of all sufferings, bereavement
by the death of friends and children, we have already spoken;
we may now consider two other conditions usually held to be
evil, namely poverty and exile. In poverty the first comfort
is in the observation that poor men are usually stronger in body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
than the rich<a id="FNanchor_2039" href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, and quite as cheerful in mind<a id="FNanchor_2040" href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. Further the
poor are free from many dangers which beset the rich; they can
travel safely even when highwaymen are watching the road<a id="FNanchor_2041" href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.
Poverty is an aid to philosophy, for a rich man, if he wishes to
philosophize, must freely choose the life of the poor<a id="FNanchor_2042" href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>. A poor
man is not troubled by insincere friends<a id="FNanchor_2043" href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. In short, poverty is
only hard for him who kicks against the pricks<a id="FNanchor_2044" href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comfort in exile.</div>

<p id="section417"><b>417.</b> The subject of exile has the special interest that in
fact so many philosophers endured this evil. To
the Stoic there is in principle no such thing as
exile, since the whole world is his country; but he does not for
this reason disregard other sources of consolation. Cicero was
plainly miserable, not only when he was formally exiled, but
also when he was away from Rome in an honourable position;
Seneca at least made the attempt to bear exile more bravely.
Is it then so hard to be away from one’s native place? Rome
is crowded with strangers, who have come thither for pleasure
or profit, study or novelty<a id="FNanchor_2045" href="#Footnote_2045" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>. True, it is a beautiful town; but
there is no place on earth so bare and unsightly, not even this
Corsica to which Seneca is banished, but that some men choose
it to reside in as a matter of taste<a id="FNanchor_2046" href="#Footnote_2046" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. Whole peoples have
changed their abode, and we find Greek cities in the midst of
barbarism, and the Macedonian language in India<a id="FNanchor_2047" href="#Footnote_2047" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>; wherever
he conquers the Roman dwells<a id="FNanchor_2048" href="#Footnote_2048" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. The exile has everywhere the
company of the same stars above<a id="FNanchor_2049" href="#Footnote_2049" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, of the same conscience
within him<a id="FNanchor_2050" href="#Footnote_2050" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>; even if he is separated from those near and dear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
to him, it is not for the first time, and he can still live with them
in his thoughts and affections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Old age.</div>

<p id="section418"><b>418.</b> Free or slave, rich or poor, powerful or insignificant,
wherever a man stands in the order of society,
old age comes at last and imperiously stops all
ambitions. It is, in the general opinion, a time of sadness<a id="FNanchor_2051" href="#Footnote_2051" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>; to
associate it with pleasure is not scandalous, only because it is
paradoxical<a id="FNanchor_2052" href="#Footnote_2052" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. Cicero’s work <i>de Senectute</i> shows how old age
became attractive according to Roman tradition; Seneca is
hardly so successful. With the fading of hope the stimulus to
effort dies away in old age<a id="FNanchor_2053" href="#Footnote_2053" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>; but though philosophy forbids
idleness, nature cries out for rest. We cannot then approve
when old men follow their professional occupations with undiminished
zeal<a id="FNanchor_2054" href="#Footnote_2054" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, and we must highly blame those who cannot
quit their pleasures<a id="FNanchor_2055" href="#Footnote_2055" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. The great boon which old age brings is
leisure; for this many great men, amongst them Augustus, have
longed in vain<a id="FNanchor_2056" href="#Footnote_2056" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. This leisure gives the opportunity of making
acquaintance with great men through their books, but better
still, that of making acquaintance with our own selves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Musonius’ ‘viaticum.’</div>

<p id="section419"><b>419.</b> ‘Give me,’ said one to Musonius, ‘<i>a viaticum</i> for old
age.’ He replied as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The rule is the same as for youth, to live methodically and according to
nature<a id="FNanchor_2057" href="#Footnote_2057" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. Do not grieve because you are cut off from the pleasures of
youth; for man is no more born for pleasure than any other animal: indeed
man alone is an image of the deity<a id="FNanchor_2058" href="#Footnote_2058" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>, and has like excellences. And do not
consider the divine excellences as beyond your reach; for we have no other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
notion of the gods than such as we derive from observing good men, whom
therefore we call divine and godlike. He who has acquired in youth sound
principles and systematic training will not be found to complain in old age
of the loss of pleasures, of weakness of body, or because he is neglected by
friends and acquaintance; he will carry about with him a charm against all
these evils, namely his own education. But if he has not been rightly
educated, he will do well to go to a friend wiser than himself, and listen to
his teaching and profit by it. And specially he will ponder over death, how
it comes in nature’s course to all, and therefore is no evil. With such
thoughts he will be cheerful and contented, and so he will live a happy life.
But let no one say that wealth brings happiness in old age; that it does not
bring a contented spirit is witnessed every day by a crowd of rich old men,
who are in bad temper and low spirits, and feel deeply aggrieved<a id="FNanchor_2059" href="#Footnote_2059" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Will-making.</div>

<p id="section420"><b>420.</b> When we see death before us there remains a last act
to be performed. We look at the wealth which no
longer belongs to us, and consider to whom it can
most worthily be entrusted. We stand in the position of a
judge who can no longer be bribed, and, with all the wisdom and
good will that we have, we give this last verdict on those around
us<a id="FNanchor_2060" href="#Footnote_2060" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death.</div>

<p id="section421"><b>421.</b> For death the whole of philosophy is a preparation;
yet when it is no longer a matter of uncertain fear,
but close at hand and sure, some last words are to
be said. All this is in the course of nature, is according to the
will of the Creator.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘God opens the door and says to you, “Go.” “Go whither?” To nothing
terrible, but to the place from which you came, to your friends and kinsmen,
to the elements<a id="FNanchor_2061" href="#Footnote_2061" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. What there was in you of fire goes to fire; of earth, to
earth; of air, to air; of water, to water. There is no Hades, nor Acheron,
nor Cocytus, but all is full of gods and demons<a id="FNanchor_2062" href="#Footnote_2062" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. God has invited you; be
content when he calls others to the feast in your place.’</p>

</div>

<p>The philosopher does not look forward to renewing his
personal life, or to meeting again with parent, wife, or child.
But death is a release from all his pains and troubles; and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
who has striven to live his life well will know how to meet death
also at its due time<a id="FNanchor_2063" href="#Footnote_2063" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. If it come to him in the shipwreck, he
will not scream nor blame God; if in the arena, he will not shrink
from his enemy, whether man or beast. In this last short crisis
he will bear witness that he accepts contentedly his mortal lot<a id="FNanchor_2064" href="#Footnote_2064" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.</p>

<span class="smaller">STOICISM IN ROMAN HISTORY AND LITERATURE.</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section422"><b>422.</b> Although up to this point it has been our main
purpose to set forth the doctrines of Stoicism,
we have seen incidentally that these came to
exercise a wide influence in Roman society, and that the later
teachers are far less occupied in the attainment of truth than in
the right guidance of disciples who lean upon them. In the
present chapter we propose to describe more particularly the
practical influence of Stoicism. Our information, whether drawn
from history or from poetry, refers generally to the upper classes
of Roman society; as to the influence of the sect amongst the
poor we have no sufficient record. But although it is very
generally held that the Stoics made no effort to reach the
working classes of Rome, or met with no success in that
direction<a id="FNanchor_2065" href="#Footnote_2065" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, the evidence points rather to an opposite conclusion,
at any rate as regards all that development of the system which
was coloured by Cynism, the philosophy of the poor<a id="FNanchor_2066" href="#Footnote_2066" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Our
actual records are therefore rather of the nature of side-lights
upon the system; the main stream of Stoic influence may well
have flowed in courses with which we are imperfectly acquainted,
and its workings may perhaps come to light first in a period of
history which lies beyond our immediate scope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conversion direct and indirect.</div>

<p id="section423"><b>423.</b> Individual Romans who professed themselves disciples
of the Porch owed their allegiance to the sect to
two causes, in varying proportion. On the one hand
they had attended lectures or private instruction
given by eminent Stoic teachers, or had immersed themselves
in Stoic literature. This influence was in almost all cases the
influence of Greek upon Roman, and the friendship between the
Stoic Panaetius and Scipio Aemilianus was the type of all
subsequent discipleship. Scipio himself did not perhaps formally
become a Stoic, but he introduced into Roman society the
atmosphere of Stoicism, known to the Romans as <i>humanitas</i>;
this included an aversion to war and civil strife, an eagerness to
appreciate the art and literature of Greece, and an admiration
for the ideals depicted by Xenophon, of the ruler in Cyrus, and
of the citizen in Socrates<a id="FNanchor_2067" href="#Footnote_2067" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. All the Stoic nobles of the time of
the republic are dominated by these feelings. On the other hand
individuals were often attracted by the existence of a society
which proclaimed itself independent of the will of rulers, and
offered its members mutual support and consolation. Such men
were often drawn into Stoicism by the persuasion of friends,
without being necessarily well-grounded in philosophical principle;
and in this way small groups or cliques might easily be formed
in which social prejudice or political bias outweighed the formal
doctrine of the school. Such a group was that of the ‘old
Romans’ of the first century of the principate; and with the
spread of Stoicism this indirect and imperfect method of attachment
constantly grows in importance as compared with direct
discipleship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scipionic circle.</div>

<p id="section424"><b>424.</b> Of the first group of Roman Stoics the most notable
was <span class="smcap">C. Laelius</span>, the intimate friend of Scipio,
who became consul in 140 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> In his youth he
had listened to the teaching of Diogenes of Babylon, in later
life he was the friend of Panaetius<a id="FNanchor_2068" href="#Footnote_2068" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. He was in his time a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
notable orator with a quiet flowing style<a id="FNanchor_2069" href="#Footnote_2069" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; his manners were
cheerful<a id="FNanchor_2070" href="#Footnote_2070" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, his temper was calm<a id="FNanchor_2071" href="#Footnote_2071" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; and, as we have seen<a id="FNanchor_2072" href="#Footnote_2072" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, he seemed
to many the nearest of all the Romans to the ideal of the Stoic
sage. He is brought on as the chief speaker in Cicero’s <i>de
Amicitia</i>. Another close friend of Africanus was <span class="smcap">Sp. Mummius</span>,
the brother of the conqueror of Achaia; his oratory was marked
by the ruggedness characteristic of the Stoic school<a id="FNanchor_2073" href="#Footnote_2073" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. Passing
mention may be made of <span class="smcap">L. Furius Philus</span>, consul in 136 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
and a member of the same group, though his philosophical views
are not known to us<a id="FNanchor_2074" href="#Footnote_2074" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gracchan period.</div>

<p id="section425"><b>425.</b> From the ‘humane’ movement sprang the Gracchan
reforms, which all alike aimed at deposing from
power the class to which the reformers by birth
belonged. To the temper of mind which made such a desire
possible Stoic doctrine had largely contributed. The Greeks
had taught their Roman pupils to see in the nascent Roman
empire, bearing the watchword of the ‘majesty of the Roman
name’ (<i>maiestas nominis Romani</i>), at least an approximation
to the ideal Cosmopolis: and many Romans so far responded
to this suggestion as to be not unfriendly towards plans for extending
their citizenship and equalizing the privileges of those
who enjoyed it. <span class="smcap">C. Blossius</span> of Cumae, a pupil of Antipater of
Tarsus, went so far as to instigate Tiberius Gracchus to the
schemes which proved his destruction<a id="FNanchor_2075" href="#Footnote_2075" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; whilst other Stoics,
equally sincere in their aims, disagreed with the violence shown
by Tiberius in his choice of method. Amongst the latter was
<span class="smcap">Q. Aelius Tubero</span>, a nephew of Africanus<a id="FNanchor_2076" href="#Footnote_2076" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, who became
consul in 118 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He devoted himself day and night to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
study of philosophy<a id="FNanchor_2077" href="#Footnote_2077" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, and though of no mark as an orator, won
himself respect by the strictness and consistency of his life<a id="FNanchor_2078" href="#Footnote_2078" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.
Panaetius, Posidonius, and Hecato all addressed treatises to
him<a id="FNanchor_2079" href="#Footnote_2079" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; and he is a leading speaker in Cicero’s <i>Republic</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Laelius to Lucilius.</div>

<p id="section426"><b>426.</b> After the fall of the Gracchi the Stoic nobles continued
to play distinguished and honourable parts
in public life. A family succession was maintained
through two daughters of Laelius, so that here we
may perhaps recognise the beginning of the deservedly famous
‘Stoic marriages.’ Of the two ladies the elder was married to
<span class="smcap">Q. Mucius Scaevola</span>, known as ‘the augur,’ who was consul in
117 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> He was a devoted friend of Panaetius, and famous for
his knowledge of civil law<a id="FNanchor_2080" href="#Footnote_2080" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. The younger daughter was married
to <span class="smcap">C. Fannius</span>, who obtained some distinction as a historian<a id="FNanchor_2081" href="#Footnote_2081" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.
In <span class="smcap">C. Lucilius</span> we find the Latin poet of Stoicism; the views
which he expresses in his satires on religion and ethics are in the
closest agreement with the teaching of Panaetius<a id="FNanchor_2082" href="#Footnote_2082" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, and the large
circulation of his poems must have diffused them through wide
circles<a id="FNanchor_2083" href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. At the same time his attacks on the religious institutions
of Numa and his ridicule of his own childish beliefs may
well have brought philosophy into ill odour as atheistic and
unpatriotic: and we find the statesmen of the next generation
specially anxious to avoid any such imputations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scaevola ‘the pontifex.’</div>

<p id="section427"><b>427.</b> A dominating figure is that of <span class="smcap">Q. Mucius Scaevola</span>,
commonly called ‘the pontifex,’ who was a nephew
of his namesake mentioned above, and derived
from him his interest in civil law; he was consul in 95 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
He overcame the difficulty about the popular religion by distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
on Stoic lines three classes of deities, (i) mythical
deities, celebrated by the poets with incredible and unworthy
narrations<a id="FNanchor_2084" href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; (ii) philosophical deities, better suited for the
schools than for the market-place; (iii) civic deities, whose
ceremonies it is the duty of state officials to maintain<a id="FNanchor_2085" href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, interpreting
them so as to agree with the philosophers rather than
with the poets<a id="FNanchor_2086" href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. In this spirit he filled the position of chief
officer of the state religion. He was however no time-server;
for being appointed after his consulship to be governor of Asia,
he joined with his former quaestor <span class="smcap">P. Rutilius Rufus</span> in the
design of repressing the extortion of the <i>publicani</i>. A decisive
step taken by him was to declare all dishonourable contracts
invalid<a id="FNanchor_2087" href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; and more than a generation later his just and sparing
administration was gratefully remembered both at Rome and in
the provinces<a id="FNanchor_2088" href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. The <i>equites</i> took their revenge not on Scaevola
but on Rutilius<a id="FNanchor_2089" href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, whom they brought to trial in 92 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when
Scaevola pleaded his cause in a simple and dignified way that
became a Stoic, but did not exclude some traces of elegance<a id="FNanchor_2090" href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
He is regarded as the father of Roman law, for he was the first
to codify it, which he did in eighteen volumes<a id="FNanchor_2091" href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. He also wrote
a special work on definitions, which no doubt reflected the
interest which the Stoics took in this part of logic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stoic lawyers.</div>

<p id="section428"><b>428.</b> It seems beyond dispute that the systematic study
of law, which developed in later centuries into
the science of Roman jurisprudence, and as such
has exercised a weighty influence on the development of
Western civilisation, had its beginnings amongst a group of
men profoundly influenced by Stoic teaching. It does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
therefore follow that the fundamental ideas expressed by such
terms as <i>ius gentium</i>, <i>lex naturae</i>, are exclusively Stoic in origin.
The former phrase appears to have been in common use at this
time to indicate the laws generally in force amongst the peoples
that surrounded Rome; the latter is a philosophical term
derived from the Greek, denoting an ideal law which ought to
exist amongst men everywhere<a id="FNanchor_2092" href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. The principle of obedience to
nature is not peculiar to the Stoic philosophy, but belongs to the
common substratum of all philosophical thought. It does
however seem to be the case that the Stoic theory of the
‘common law’ (κοινὸς νόμος) was in fact the stimulus which
enabled the Romans to transform their system of ‘rights,’
gradually throwing over all that was of the nature of mechanical
routine or caste privilege, and harmonizing contradictions by the
principle of fairness. The successor of Scaevola was <span class="smcap">C. Aquilius
Gallus</span>, praetor in 66 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> with Cicero, of whom it is specially
noted that he guided his exposition of law by the principle of
equity<a id="FNanchor_2093" href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; and after him <span class="smcap">S. Sulpicius Rufus</span>, the contemporary
and intimate friend of Cicero. We do not know that he was
a Stoic, but he was a student of dialectic under <span class="smcap">L. Lucilius
Balbus</span>, who as well as his brother belonged to this school<a id="FNanchor_2094" href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; and
he followed Stoic principles in studying oratory just enough to
make his exposition clear<a id="FNanchor_2095" href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. He was the acknowledged head of
his profession, and compiled 180 books on law<a id="FNanchor_2096" href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. In the civil
war he took sides with Caesar<a id="FNanchor_2097" href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoics of the Sullan period.</div>

<p id="section429"><b>429.</b> Amongst men of high rank definitely pledged to
Stoicism in the generation preceding Cicero are
further <span class="smcap">L. Aelius Stilo</span> (circ. 145-75 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_2098" href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, who
devoted himself to Roman grammar and antiquities, and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
the teacher of both Cicero and Varro; <span class="smcap">Q. Lucilius Balbus</span>,
whose knowledge of this philosophy rivalled that of his Greek
teachers<a id="FNanchor_2099" href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, and who is the exponent of the Stoic view in Cicero’s
<i>de Natura Deorum</i>, the scene of which takes us back to about
76 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; <span class="smcap">Sextus Pompeius</span>, uncle of Pompey the Great, and
distinguished both as a philosopher and as a jurist<a id="FNanchor_2100" href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; and more
particularly <span class="smcap">P. Rutilius Rufus</span>, to whom we have already
referred<a id="FNanchor_2101" href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. A pupil and devoted admirer of Panaetius<a id="FNanchor_2102" href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, a trained
philosopher<a id="FNanchor_2103" href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, and a sound lawyer<a id="FNanchor_2104" href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, he brought his career at
Rome to an abrupt end by his firm resistance to the <i>publicani</i>,
as already recounted<a id="FNanchor_2105" href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. With true cosmopolitanism he retired
to Smyrna, and accepted the citizenship of that town. His stern
principles did not prevent him from saving his life in the massacre
ordered by Mithradates, by assuming Greek dress<a id="FNanchor_2106" href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>; the massacre
itself was the ripe fruit of the abuses which he had endeavoured
to repress. He is one of the characters in Cicero’s <i>de Republica</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cato.</div>

<p id="section430"><b>430.</b> Of the Stoics of Cicero’s time the most eminent was
<span class="smcap">M. Porcius Cato</span> (95-48 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). In him Stoicism
received a special colouring by association with the
traditions of ancient Roman manners. In his early years he
became a pupil of Antipater of Tyre<a id="FNanchor_2107" href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, and so far adopted the
Cynic ideal as to train himself for public life by freely submitting
to hunger, cold, and hardship<a id="FNanchor_2108" href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. After a period of service in the
army he made a journey to Asia to secure the companionship of
Athenodorus the elder<a id="FNanchor_2109" href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. He became a practised speaker; and
though he adhered firmly to the Stoic tradition of plain language
and short sentences<a id="FNanchor_2110" href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, yet could become eloquent on the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
themes of his philosophy<a id="FNanchor_2111" href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, and could win the approval of the
people even for its paradoxes<a id="FNanchor_2112" href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. He was resolutely opposed to
bribery and extortion. As quaestor in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 66 he introduced
reform into the public finances, and put an end to embezzlements
by officials. His popularity became very great, and he was
elected tribune of the plebs towards the end of the year 63 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
when his voice decided the senators to decree the death of the
associates of Catiline. With his subsequent policy Cicero finds
fault, because Cato refused to connive at the extortions of the
<i>publicani</i>: and from Cicero’s criticisms has arisen the accepted
view that Cato was an unpractical statesman. On the other
hand it may well be held that if the Roman aristocracy had
included more men like Cato, the republic might have been
saved: and towards the end of his life Cicero bitterly lamented
that he had not sufficiently valued the sincere friendship which
Cato offered him<a id="FNanchor_2113" href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. In the year 54 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the candidates for the
office of tribune paid him a singular compliment; each deposited
with him a large sum of money, which he was to forfeit if in
Cato’s opinion he was guilty of bribery<a id="FNanchor_2114" href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. His whole political
life was guided by the strictest moral principle<a id="FNanchor_2115" href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>; even in so
unimportant a matter as Cicero’s request for a triumph he would
do nothing to oblige a friend<a id="FNanchor_2116" href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. In private life he attempted to
put into practice the principle of the community of women
taught in Zeno’s <i>Republic</i>. He had married Marcia, daughter
of Philippus, and had three children by her: in 56 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he gave
her up to his friend C. Hortensius, whose family was in danger
of becoming extinct: finally on the threatening of the civil war
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 50 he took her back to his own home. At a time when
the marriage bond was lightly treated by many of his contemporaries
he at least rose above petty motives. In the civil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
war he took sides strongly against Caesar, his old political
opponent. His self-sought death after Pharsalia won him a
distinction which he had earned better by his life: and the
unmeasured praise bestowed upon him a century later is perhaps
due more to political bias than to philosophical respect<a id="FNanchor_2117" href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. The
few words with which Virgil honours his memory are more
effective, when he pictures Cato as chosen to be a judge in the
world of the blest<a id="FNanchor_2118" href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Cato represents the Stoic view as to the
<i>summum bonum</i> in Cicero’s <i>de Finibus</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Varro, Brutus and Porcia.</div>

<p id="section431"><b>431.</b> Contemporary with Cicero and Cato was <span class="smcap">M. Terentius
Varro</span> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 116-28). In his public career and
political principles he was not unlike Cato; in his
literary activity he more resembled Cicero. Both Varro and
Cicero were deeply influenced by Stoic teaching, but as they
were by no means professed adherents of this philosophy<a id="FNanchor_2119" href="#Footnote_2119" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>,
they may be here passed by. In the next generation
<span class="smcap">M. Junius Brutus</span> (85-42 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) concerns us more: for by
his marriage with <span class="smcap">Porcia</span>, Cato’s daughter and an ardent Stoic,
he came into a family connexion with the sect, with which his
personal views, as we have seen, were not entirely in agreement<a id="FNanchor_2120" href="#Footnote_2120" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.
Still Brutus was not altogether unfitted to play the part of
Cato’s successor; he was no mean orator<a id="FNanchor_2121" href="#Footnote_2121" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, and wrote more than
one philosophical treatise<a id="FNanchor_2122" href="#Footnote_2122" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>; whilst Cicero dedicated several of
his philosophical works to him<a id="FNanchor_2123" href="#Footnote_2123" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. But the practical Stoicism of
Porcia, who stabbed herself in the thigh to show that she was
fit to be trusted with a political secret, shines out more brightly
than the speculations of her husband. In her honour Martial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
has written one of the few epigrams in which he allows himself
to be caught in a mood of admiration: yet his story of Porcia’s
death must be rejected as unhistorical<a id="FNanchor_2124" href="#Footnote_2124" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horace.</div>

<p id="section432"><b>432.</b> After the death of Brutus Stoicism ceases for a while
to play a prominent part in Roman history; but its
indirect influence is very marked in the two great
poets of the Augustan epoch, Horace and Virgil. Of these
<span class="smcap">Horace</span> is in the main an Epicurean, and as such is quite entitled
to use the Stoic paradoxes as matter for ridicule, and even to
anticipate dangerous consequences from their practical application<a id="FNanchor_2125" href="#Footnote_2125" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.
But in fact his works show a constantly increasing
appreciation of the ethics of Stoicism. He recognises the high
ideals and civic activity of its professors<a id="FNanchor_2126" href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, and he draws a noble
picture of the Stoic sage, confident in his convictions, and bidding
defiance to the crowd and the tyrant alike<a id="FNanchor_2127" href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. Of that practical
wisdom and genial criticism which has made Horace the
favourite poet of so many men eminent in public life, no small
part consists of Stoic principles deftly freed from the paradoxical
form in which they were conveyed to professed adherents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virgil.</div>

<p id="section433"><b>433.</b> With this picture of Stoicism seen from without we
must contrast that given us by <span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, who inherited
the Stoic tradition from Aratus<a id="FNanchor_2128" href="#Footnote_2128" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, his model for the
<i>Georgics</i>. Virgil’s mind is penetrated by Stoic feeling, and his
works are an interpretation of the universe in the Stoic sense;
but like so many of his contemporaries he holds aloof from
formal adherence to the sect, and carefully avoids its technical
language. Quite possibly too he incorporated in his system
elements drawn from other philosophies. In physics he accepts
the principle that the fiery aether is the source of all life<a id="FNanchor_2129" href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; it is
identical with the divine spirit<a id="FNanchor_2130" href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and the all-informing mind<a id="FNanchor_2131" href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.
From this standpoint he is led on to the doctrine of purgatory<a id="FNanchor_2132" href="#Footnote_2132" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
and from that he looks forward to the time of the conflagration,
when all creation will be reconciled by returning to its primitive
unity in the primal fire-spirit<a id="FNanchor_2133" href="#Footnote_2133" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Still Virgil’s picture must be
regarded rather as an adaptation than as an exposition of
Stoicism; it lacks the sharp outlines and the didactic tone of
the poetry of Cleanthes or Lucretius, and other interpretations
are by no means excluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virgil’s theology.</div>

<p id="section434"><b>434.</b> With the problem of the government of the universe
Virgil’s mind is occupied throughout the <i>Aeneid</i>.
He is constantly weighing the relative importance
of the three forces, fate, the gods, and fortune, precisely as the
philosophers do. To each of the three he assigns a part in the
affairs of men; but that taken by fate is unmistakably predominant.
The individual gods have very little importance in the
poem; they are to a large extent allegorical figures, representing
human instincts and passions; they cannot divert destiny from
its path, though with their utmost effort they may slightly delay
its work or change its incidence. Above all these little gods
Jove towers aloft, a power magnificent and munificent; at his
voice the gods shudder and the worlds obey. But the power
of Jove rests upon his complete acceptance of the irrevocable
decrees of fate<a id="FNanchor_2134" href="#Footnote_2134" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. The critic may even describe him as a puppet-king,
who wears an outward semblance of royalty, but is really
obedient to an incessant interference from a higher authority.
Virgil however appears truly to hold the Stoic principle that
Fate and Jove are one; he thus takes us at once to the final
problem of philosophy, the reconciliation of the conceptions of
Law formed on the one hand by observing facts (the modern
‘Laws of Nature’) and on the other hand by recognising the
moral instinct (the modern ‘Moral Law’). As we have seen, a
reconciliation of these two by logic is intrinsically impossible.
Virgil however shows us how they may be in practice reconciled
by a certain attitude of mind; and because that attitude is one
of resignation to and cooperation with the supreme power, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
would seem right to place Virgil by the side of Cleanthes as one
of the religious poets of Stoicism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virgil’s ethics.</div>

<p id="section435"><b>435.</b> Virgil’s conception of ethics is displayed in the character
of Aeneas. Much modern criticism revolts against
the character of Aeneas exactly as it does against
that of Cato, and for the same reason, that it is without sympathy
for Stoic ethics. To understand Aeneas we must first picture a
man whose whole soul is filled by a reverent regard for destiny
and submission to Jove, who represents destiny on its personal
side. He can therefore never play the part of the hero in revolt;
but at the same time he is human, and liable to those petty
weaknesses and aberrations from which even the sage is not
exempt. He can hesitate or be hasty, can love or weep; but
the sovereignty of his mind is never upset. In a happy phrase
Virgil sums up the whole ethics of Stoicism:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Calm in his soul he abides, and the tears roll down, but in vain<a id="FNanchor_2135" href="#Footnote_2135" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In contrast to Aeneas stands Dido, intensely human and
passionate, and in full rebellion against her destiny. She is to
him Eve the temptress, Cleopatra the seducer; but she is not
destined to win a final triumph. A modern romance would
doubtless have a different ending.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ovid.</div>

<p id="section436"><b>436.</b> Amongst writers who adopted much of the formal
teaching of Stoicism without imbibing its spirit
we may reckon <span class="smcap">Ovid</span> (43 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>-18 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). Not only
does he accept the central idea of Stoicism, that it is the divine
fire by virtue of which every man lives and moves<a id="FNanchor_2136" href="#Footnote_2136" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, but he opens
his greatest work by a description of the creation<a id="FNanchor_2137" href="#Footnote_2137" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> which appears
to follow Stoic lines, and in which the erect figure of man is
specially recognised as the proof of the preeminence which
Providence has assigned to him over all the other works of the
Creator<a id="FNanchor_2138" href="#Footnote_2138" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. But the tales related in the <i>Metamorphoses</i> show no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
trace of the serious religious purpose of Virgil; and the society
pictured in Ovid’s love poems gives only a caricature of the
Stoic doctrines of the community of women, the absence of
jealousy, and outspokenness of speech. Finally the plaintive
tone of the <i>Tristia</i> shows how little Ovid was in touch with
Stoic self-control amidst the buffetings of fortune.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cremutius Cordus.</div>

<p id="section437"><b>437.</b> In the time of the next <i>princeps</i> we first find
Stoicism associated with an unsympathetic attitude
towards the imperial government. There was
nothing in Stoic principles to suggest this opposition. Tiberius
himself had listened to the teaching of the Stoic Nestor, and the
simplicity of his personal life and the gravity of his manners
might well have won him the support of sincere philosophers.
But if Stoicism did not create the spirit of opposition, it confirmed
it where it already existed. The memory of Cato
associated Stoic doctrines with republican views: vague idealisations
of Brutus and Cassius suggested the glorification of
tyrannicide. <span class="smcap">Cremutius Cordus</span> (ob. <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 25) had offended
Seianus by a sarcastic remark: for when Tiberius repaired the
theatre of Pompey, and the senate voted that a statue of Seianus
should be erected there, Cordus said that this meant really
spoiling the theatre<a id="FNanchor_2139" href="#Footnote_2139" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. Seianus then dropped a hint to his client
Satrius, who accused Cordus before the senate of writing a
history in which he highly praised Brutus, and declared Cassius
to have been ‘the last of the Romans.’ A word of apology
would have saved the life of Cordus; he resolved to die by his
own act<a id="FNanchor_2140" href="#Footnote_2140" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, to the great annoyance of his prosecutors<a id="FNanchor_2141" href="#Footnote_2141" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. From
this time on suicide became an object of political ambition. The
Stoic tradition continued in the family of Cordus, and to his
daughter Marcia, as a fellow-member of the sect, Seneca addressed
the well-known <i>Consolatio</i><a id="FNanchor_2142" href="#Footnote_2142" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>; but the title of ‘old Romans’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
describes far better the true leanings of the men of whom Cordus
was the forerunner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kanus Iulius.</div>

<p id="section438"><b>438.</b> In the reign of Gaius (Caligula) we first find philosophers
as such exposed to persecution; and we may
infer that, like the Jews, they resisted tacitly or
openly the claim of the emperor to be worshipped as a god.
<span class="smcap">Iulius Graecinus</span>, according to Seneca, was put to death for
no other reason than that he was a better man than a tyrant
liked to see alive<a id="FNanchor_2143" href="#Footnote_2143" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. <span class="smcap">Kanus Iulius</span> reproved the emperor to
his face, and heard with calmness his own doom pronounced.
During the ten days still left to him he went quietly on with his
daily occupations; he was engaged in a game of chess when the
centurion summoned him. ‘After my death,’ he said to his
opponent, ‘do not boast that you won the game.’ His philosopher
accompanied him, and inquired how his thoughts were occupied.
‘I propose,’ said Kanus, ‘to observe whether at the last moment
the soul is conscious of its departure. Afterwards, if I discover
what the condition of departed souls is, I will come back and
inform my friends<a id="FNanchor_2144" href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arria the elder.</div>

<p id="section439"><b>439.</b> In the reign of Claudius we find Stoics engaged in
actual conspiracy against the emperor. The name
of <span class="smcap">Paetus Caecina</span> introduces us to a famous
Stoic family, for his wife was <span class="smcap">Arria</span> the elder. Pliny tells us,
on the authority of her granddaughter Fannia, how when her
husband and son both fell sick together, and the latter died, she
carried out the whole funeral without her husband’s knowledge;
and each time that she entered his sick chamber, assumed a
cheerful smile and assured him that the boy was much better.
Whenever her grief became too strong, she would leave the
room for a few minutes to weep, and return once more calm.
When Scribonianus in Illyria rebelled against Claudius, Paetus
took his side; upon his fall he was brought a prisoner to Rome.
Arria was not allowed to accompany him, but she followed him
in a fishing boat. She encouraged him to face death by piercing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
her own breast with a dagger, declaring ‘it doesn’t hurt<a id="FNanchor_2145" href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>,’ and
upon his death she determined not to survive him. Thrasea,
her son-in-law, tried to dissuade her. ‘If I were condemned,
would you,’ said he, ‘wish your daughter to die with me?’
‘Yes,’ said Arria, ‘if she had lived with you as long and as
happily as I with Paetus.’ Here we have a deliberate justification
of the Hindu practice of the Satī.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seneca.</div>

<p id="section440"><b>440.</b> In the reign of Nero the Stoics are still more prominent,
and almost always in opposition. <span class="smcap">Seneca</span>, of
course, the emperor’s tutor and minister, is on the
government side; and from his life we can draw the truest
picture of the imperial civil servant in high office. We shall
certainly not expect to find that Seneca illustrated in his own
life all the virtues that he preached; on the other hand we shall
not readily believe that the ardent disciple of Attalus<a id="FNanchor_2146" href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and
affectionate husband of Paulina was a man of dissolute life or of
avaricious passions. Simple tastes, an endless capacity for hard
work, and scrupulous honesty were the ordinary marks of the
Roman official in those days, as they are of members of the
Civil Service of India to-day<a id="FNanchor_2147" href="#Footnote_2147" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. Seneca is often accused of
having been too supple as a minister; but he was carrying out
the principles of his sect better by taking an active part in
politics than if he had, like many others, held sullenly aloof<a id="FNanchor_2148" href="#Footnote_2148" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.
He did not indeed imitate Cato or Rutilius Rufus, who had
carried firmness of principle to an extent that laid them open
to the charge of obstinacy; but in submitting frankly to power
greater than his own he still saw to it that his own influence
should count towards the better side. For the story of his
political career we cannot do better than to refer to the latest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
historian of his times<a id="FNanchor_2149" href="#Footnote_2149" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>; of his work as a philosopher, to which
he himself attributed the greater importance, a general account
has been given above<a id="FNanchor_2150" href="#Footnote_2150" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and more particular discussions form the
central theme of this book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persius and Lucan.</div>

<p id="section441"><b>441.</b> From Seneca we pass naturally to some mention of
the poets Persius and Lucan. <span class="smcap">A. Persius Flaccus</span>
(34-62 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) became at 16 years of age the pupil
and companion of the Stoic philosopher Cornutus: he was also
a relative of the Arriae already mentioned. He gives us a
charming picture of his teacher’s ways of life, which were
doubtless typical<a id="FNanchor_2151" href="#Footnote_2151" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>: and his summary view of the scope of
philosophy well indicates how its proportions had shrunk at
this period. Dialectic is not mentioned, and physics has
interest only in its bearing upon the position and duty of
the individual.</p>

<p>His contemporary <span class="smcap">M. Annaeus Lucanus</span> (39-65 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), a
nephew of Seneca, plunged more deeply both into philosophy
and into politics. In both he displayed ardour insufficiently
tempered with discretion; he had a far keener sense of his
personal grievances than became a Stoic, and was much more of
a critic than of a reformer. Yet hardly any writer expresses
more forcibly the characteristic doctrines of Stoicism, as they

<div class="sidenote">Civil service and ‘old Romans.’</div>

<p id="section442"><b>442.</b> The careers of Seneca and Musonius, and the early
years of Lucan himself, indicate sufficiently that
there was no essential opposition between Stoic
principles and the Roman principate; in other
words, that Stoics as such were not ‘republicans.’ Rather the
contrary; for nearly all the Greek philosophers had been inclined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
to favour monarchy, and the Stoics had been conspicuous in the
desire to abolish the distinctions of birth and class upon which
the Roman aristocracy laid so much stress, and which the principate
was disposed to ignore. But in fact Stoicism was the
common mould in which the educated youth of Rome were
shaped at this period; it produced honest, diligent, and simple-minded
men, exactly suited to be instruments of the great
imperial bureaucracy. Large numbers entered the service of
the state, and were heard of no more; such an one (except for
Seneca’s incidental account of him) was <span class="smcap">C. Lucilius</span>, Seneca’s
correspondent. The great work of Roman government was
carried on in silence, just as that of India in the present day.
This silence was probably on the whole beneficial to society,
though it was often felt as a constraint by the individual. For
this reason and many others there were at Rome (as everywhere
and at all times) many able but disappointed men; they became
the critics of the government, and from being critics they might
at any time become conspirators; but at no period did they
seriously aim at restoring the republican system. Their political
creed was limited, and did not look beyond the interests of the
class from which they sprang. They claimed for members of
the senate at Rome their ancient personal privileges, and
especially that of <i>libertas</i>, that is, freedom to criticize and even
to insult the members of the government; they sang the praises
of Cato, celebrated the birthdays of Brutus and Cassius<a id="FNanchor_2159" href="#Footnote_2159" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, and
practised a kind of ‘passive resistance’ based on Oriental
methods, by quitting life without hesitation when they were
baulked in their immediate wishes by the government. When
the administration was carried on decently these men were
ridiculous; when from time to time it became a scandal they
were heroes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Republican prejudices.</div>

<p id="section443"><b>443.</b> The early years of Nero’s reign show us plainly that
true spirit of Stoicism was far more developed
on the side of the government than on that of the
aristocracy. Nothing distinguishes Seneca more honourably
than his humane attitude towards the slave population; and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
was chief minister of the princeps when in the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 61 a
‘notable case<a id="FNanchor_2160" href="#Footnote_2160" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>’ arose, in which the human rights of slaves were
involved. The city prefect, Pedanius Secundus, was killed by
one of his slaves. It was contended in the senate that by ancient
custom the whole household, old and young, guilty and innocent,
must be put to death alike; and this view prevailed and was
carried into effect. Public opinion, according to Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_2161" href="#Footnote_2161" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>, was
unanimous against such severity; it looked, not unreasonably, to
the emperor and his minister to prevent it<a id="FNanchor_2162" href="#Footnote_2162" class="fnanchor">[97a]</a>. They on the contrary
left the decision to the free judgment of the senate.
Where now were the men of philosophic principle, of world-wide
sympathies, of outspoken utterance? The historian tells us that
not one was found in the senate. The honourable men who could
defy an emperor’s death-sentence still lacked the courage to speak
out against the prejudices of their own class; many indeed uttered
exclamations, expressing pity for the women, the young, and the
indubitably innocent, and even voted against the executions;
but even in so simple a matter there was not a man to follow
the lead of Catiline in Cicero’s days, and take up as his own the
cause of the oppressed. The leader of the merciless majority
was C. Cassius Longinus, a celebrated jurist, and one who
regularly celebrated the honours of Cassius the conspirator.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nero and the Stoics.</div>

<p id="section444"><b>444.</b> But although the administration of which Nero was
the head was largely manned by professed Stoics,
and stood as a whole for the better sympathies of
the Roman people, the course of court intrigue brought about a
fierce conflict between the government and a growing force of
public opinion of which the ‘old Roman’ group of Stoics were
sometimes the spokesmen, and at other times the silent representatives.
To Nero the consideration of his own safety was
predominant over every consideration of justice to individuals,
and herein he stood condemned (and knew that it was so) by
the judgment of all men of philosophic temper. The first of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
victims, and perhaps the most deserving of our admiration, was
<span class="smcap">Rubellius Plautus</span>, accused by Tigellinus because he maintained
the irritating cult of the ‘tyrannicides,’ and had joined the
disloyal sect of the Stoics<a id="FNanchor_2163" href="#Footnote_2163" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. The charge of disloyalty against
himself and his companions he disproved; for, advised by his
Stoic teachers Coeranus and Musonius, he declined to take part
in a rising which might have been successful, and calmly awaited
his fate (60 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). In the conspiracy of Piso, which broke out a
few years later, <span class="smcap">Plautus Lateranus</span> is named by the historian
as one of the few whose motives were honourable and whose
conduct was consistently courageous<a id="FNanchor_2164" href="#Footnote_2164" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. The later years of Nero’s
reign are illuminated in the pages of Tacitus by the firmness of
men like <span class="smcap">Thrasea Paetus</span>, <span class="smcap">Paconius Agrippinus</span>, and <span class="smcap">Barea
Soranus</span>, and the heroic devotion of women like the younger
<span class="smcap">Arria</span>, Thrasea’s wife, and <span class="smcap">Servilia</span>, the daughter of Soranus<a id="FNanchor_2165" href="#Footnote_2165" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.
In the persecution of this group the modern historian finds extenuating
circumstances, but at Rome itself it appeared as though
the emperor were engaged in the attempt to extirpate virtue
itself<a id="FNanchor_2166" href="#Footnote_2166" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Helvidius Priscus.</div>

<p id="section445"><b>445.</b> Upon the fall of Nero the ‘old Romans’ came for a
short time into power under the principate of Galba,
and amongst others <span class="smcap">Helvidius Priscus</span>, Thrasea’s
son-in-law, returned from exile. From the account of Tacitus
he appears to have been a very sincere adherent of the Stoic
school.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘He was not like others who adopt the name of philosopher in order to
cloak an idle disposition. He followed those teachers who maintain that
only the honourable is good, and only the base is evil; power, nobility, and
other things external to the soul being neither good nor evil. He designed
so to fortify himself thereby against the blows of fortune that he could play
his part in public affairs without flinching<a id="FNanchor_2167" href="#Footnote_2167" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>His first act on returning to Rome was to commence a
prosecution of the accuser of Thrasea. The senate was divided
in opinion as to the wisdom of this step, and when Helvidius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
abandoned the suit some praised his charity, whilst others
lamented his indecision<a id="FNanchor_2168" href="#Footnote_2168" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. He resumed his attempt, as we shall
see, at a later time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His fall.</div>

<p id="section446"><b>446.</b> Vespasian was undoubtedly tolerant in his views: his
reign began with the restitution of honours to the
deceased Galba, and the much-respected Musonius<a id="FNanchor_2169" href="#Footnote_2169" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
seized the opportunity to attack in the senate P. Egnatius Celer,
whose treachery had brought about the fall of Soranus<a id="FNanchor_2170" href="#Footnote_2170" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, for
false evidence. The trial was postponed, but resulted a little
later in the condemnation of Celer<a id="FNanchor_2171" href="#Footnote_2171" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. Public opinion took the
side of Musonius: but the accused found a champion in
Demetrius the Cynic philosopher, and at least defended himself
with the ability and courage of his sect. Thereupon Helvidius
resumed his prosecution of the accuser of Thrasea; but the
emperor, now anxious to let bygones be bygones, refused to
approve<a id="FNanchor_2172" href="#Footnote_2172" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. This second failure appears to have embittered
Helvidius: his opposition to Vespasian became open and insulting,
and brought about his death<a id="FNanchor_2173" href="#Footnote_2173" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. The life of his wife <span class="smcap">Fannia</span>
was worthy of the two Arriae, her grandmother and her mother.
Twice she followed her husband into exile; a third time she
brought this punishment upon herself, by encouraging his friend
Senecio to publish his biography, supplying him with the
materials, and openly justifying her action. In her private life
she had singular charm and affability; and her death appeared
to Pliny to close an era of noble women<a id="FNanchor_2174" href="#Footnote_2174" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewal of the Stoic opposition.</div>

<p id="section447"><b>447.</b> It seems probable that the Stoic nobles found the low
birth of Vespasian as intolerable as the tyranny of
Nero; at any rate they soon resumed their attitude
of opposition to the government, and the punishment
of Helvidius, if intended as a warning, proved rather a
provocation. It appears that he and the ‘old Romans’ began
a systematic propaganda in favour of what they called
‘democracy<a id="FNanchor_2175" href="#Footnote_2175" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>,’ that is, the government of the Roman empire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
by the senatorial class; and they probably involved many
professed philosophers in this impracticable and reactionary
movement. Vespasian resolved on expelling all the philosophers
from Rome. From this general sentence the best known of all,
Musonius, was excepted<a id="FNanchor_2176" href="#Footnote_2176" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>, and we must infer that he had shown
the good sense to keep himself free from political entanglements.
In spite of this act of Vespasian, Stoicism continued to gain
ground, and during the greater part of the period of the Flavian
dynasty met with little interference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Persecution by Domitian.</div>

<p id="section448"><b>448.</b> But towards the end of the reign of Domitian a more
violent persecution broke out. <span class="smcap">Arulenus Rusticus</span>
had been tribune of the plebs in 66 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and had
then proposed to use his veto in an attempt to save the life of
Thrasea Paetus<a id="FNanchor_2177" href="#Footnote_2177" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. In 69 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> he was praetor, and as such headed
an embassy sent by the senate to the soldiers under Petilius
Cerealis. On this occasion he was roughly handled and wounded,
and barely escaped with his life<a id="FNanchor_2178" href="#Footnote_2178" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. After many years of quiet,
he was accused in 93 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, when Pliny was praetor, of having
written and spoken in honour of Thrasea Paetus, Herennius
Senecio, and Helvidius Priscus; he was condemned to death and
his books were destroyed<a id="FNanchor_2179" href="#Footnote_2179" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. <span class="smcap">Senecio</span> was condemned at the
same time for having written the biography of Helvidius Priscus,
and for the further offence that since holding the quaestorship he
had not become a candidate for any higher office<a id="FNanchor_2180" href="#Footnote_2180" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. About the
same time were banished Artemidorus, the most single-minded
and laborious of philosophers, whom Musonius had selected out
of a crowd of competitors as the fittest to claim his daughter in
marriage<a id="FNanchor_2181" href="#Footnote_2181" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>; Junius Mauricus, brother of Arulenus Rusticus, who
had joined Musonius in the attempt to secure the punishment of
the <i>delatores</i> of Nero’s time<a id="FNanchor_2182" href="#Footnote_2182" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>; Demetrius, and Epictetus<a id="FNanchor_2183" href="#Footnote_2183" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>; and
further many distinguished ladies, including Arria and her
daughter Fannia<a id="FNanchor_2184" href="#Footnote_2184" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. But from the time of the death of Domitian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 96 the imperial government became finally reconciled
with Stoicism, which was now the recognised creed of the great
majority of the educated classes at Rome, of all ages and ranks.
As such it appears in the writings of <span class="smcap">Juvenal</span>, who not only
introduces into serious literature the Stoic principle of ‘straight
speaking,’ but actually expounds much of the ethical teaching
of Stoicism with more directness and force than any professed
adherent of the system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoic reform of law.</div>

<p id="section449"><b>449.</b> Stoicism, received into favour in the second century
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, won new opportunities and was exposed to
new dangers. Its greatest achievement lay in the
development of Roman law. As we have just seen<a id="FNanchor_2185" href="#Footnote_2185" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>, the ‘old
Romans’ of Nero’s day, in spite of their profession of Stoicism,
were unbending upholders of the old law, with all its harshness
and narrowness; and we have to go back a hundred years to the
great lawyers of the times of Sulla and Cicero<a id="FNanchor_2186" href="#Footnote_2186" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> to meet with
men prepared to throw aside old traditions and build anew on
the foundations of natural justice. But the larger view had not
been lost sight of. It remained as the ideal of the more generous-minded
members of the imperial civil service; and in the times
of the emperors Antoninus Pius (138-161 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) and Marcus
Aurelius (161-180 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) it became the starting-point for a new
development of Roman law, which is one of the great achievements
of Roman history. The most eloquent of the historians
of the origins of Christianity thus describes this movement.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Le stoïcisme avait [déjà] pénétré le droit romain de ses larges maximes,
et en avait fait le droit naturel, le droit philosophique, tel que la raison peut
le concevoir pour tous les hommes. Le droit strict cède à l’équité; la
douceur l’emporte sur la sévérité; la justice paraît inséparable de la bienfaisance.
Les grands jurisconsultes d’Antonin continuèrent la même œuvre.
Le dernier [Volusius Moecianus] fut le maître de Marc-Aurèle en fait de
jurisprudence, et, à vrai dire, l’œuvre des deux saints empereurs ne saurait
être séparée. C’est d’eux que datent la plupart de ces lois humaines et
sensées qui fléchirent la rigueur du droit antique et firent, d’une législation
primitivement étroite et implacable, un code susceptible d’être adopté par
tous les peuples civilisés<a id="FNanchor_2187" href="#Footnote_2187" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span></p>

<p>In the legislation of Antoninus and Aurelius the humane and
cosmopolitan principles of Stoic politics at last triumph over
Roman conservatism. The poor, the sick, the infant, and the
famine-stricken are protected. The slave is treated as a human
being; to kill him becomes a crime, to injure him a misdemeanour;
his family and his property are protected by the tribunals.
Slavery in fact is treated as a violation of the rights of nature;
manumission is in every way encouraged. The time is within
sight when Ulpian will declare that ‘all men, according to natural
right, are born free and equal<a id="FNanchor_2188" href="#Footnote_2188" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.’ This legislation is not entirely
the work of professed Stoics; it is nevertheless the offspring of
Stoicism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Repression of zeal.</div>

<p id="section450"><b>450.</b> There was in the second century, as there is still, a
sharp antagonism between the manners of cultivated
society and the ardent profession of intellectual
convictions. An anecdote related by Gellius well illustrates the
social forces which were now constantly at work to check superfluous
enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘There was with us at table a young student of philosophy who called
himself a Stoic, but chiefly distinguished himself by an unwelcome loquacity.
He was always bringing up in season and out of season recondite philosophical
doctrines, and he looked upon all his neighbours as boors because they were
unacquainted with them. His whole talk was strown with mention of syllogisms,
fallacies, and the like, such as the “master-argument,” the “quiescent,”
and the “heap”; and he thought that he was the only man in the world who
could solve them. Further he maintained that he had thoroughly studied
the nature of the soul, the growth of virtue, the science of daily duties, and
the cure of the weaknesses and diseases of the mind. Finally he considered
he had attained to that state of perfect happiness which could be clouded by
no disappointment, shaken by no pains of death<a id="FNanchor_2189" href="#Footnote_2189" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Such a man, we may think, might soon have become an
apostle of sincere Stoicism, and might have left us a clear and
systematic exposition of Stoic doctrine as refined by five
centuries of experience. It was not to be. The polished Herodes
Atticus crushed him with a quotation from the discourses of
Epictetus. Not many offended in the same way. Even Seneca<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
had been severe on useless study in the regions of history and
antiquity<a id="FNanchor_2190" href="#Footnote_2190" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>; the new philosophers despised the study even of
philosophy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State establishment of philosophy.</div>

<p id="section451"><b>451.</b> The Stoicism of the second century is therefore much
less sharply defined than that of earlier times. Its
doctrines, acquired in childhood, are accepted with
ready acquiescence; but they are not accompanied
by any firm repudiation of the opposing views of other schools.
Once more, as in the time of Augustus, the ‘philosopher’ comes
to the front; the particular colour of his philosophy seems of
less importance<a id="FNanchor_2191" href="#Footnote_2191" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. It is philosophy in general which wins the
patronage of the emperors. Nerva allowed the schools of the
philosophers to be re-opened; Trajan interested himself in them
as providing a useful training for the young. Hadrian went
further, and endowed the teachers of philosophy at Rome;
Antoninus Pius did the same throughout the provinces. Marcus
Aurelius established representatives of each of the philosophic
schools at Athens; and amongst later emperors Septimius
Severus, aided by his wife Julia Domna, was conspicuous in the
same direction. The philosophers, who had firmly resisted
persecution, gradually sacrificed their independence under the
influence of imperial favour. They still recited the dogmas
of their respective founders, but unconsciously they became the
partisans of the established forms of government and religion.
Yet so gentle was the decay of philosophy that it might be
regarded as progress if its true position were not illuminated by
the attitude of Marcus Aurelius towards the Christians. For
Marcus Aurelius was universally accepted as the most admirable
practical representative of philosophy in its full ripeness, and no
word of criticism of his policy was uttered by any teacher of
Stoicism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The pagan revival.</div>

<p id="section452"><b>452.</b> The decay of precise philosophic thought was accompanied
by a strong revival of pagan religious
sentiment. The atmosphere in which Marcus
Aurelius grew up, and by which his political actions were
determined far more than by his philosophic profession, is thus
sympathetically described by the latest editor of his Reflections.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘In house and town, the ancestral Penates of the hearth and the Lares of
the streets guarded the intercourse of life; in the individual breast, a ministering
Genius shaped his destinies and responded to each mood of melancholy
or of mirth. Thus all life lay under the regimen of spiritual powers, to be
propitiated or appeased by appointed observances and ritual and forms of
prayer. To this punctilious and devout form of Paganism Marcus was
inured from childhood; at the vintage festival he took his part in chant and
sacrifice; at eight years old he was admitted to the Salian priesthood; “he
was observed to perform all his sacerdotal functions with a constancy and
exactness unusual at that age; was soon a master of the sacred music; and
had all the forms and liturgies by heart.” Our earliest statue depicts him as
a youth offering incense; and in his triumphal bas-reliefs he stands before the
altar, a robed and sacrificing priest. To him “prayer and sacrifice, and all
observances by which we own the presence and nearness of the gods,” are
“covenants and sacred ministries” admitting to “intimate communion with
the divine<a id="FNanchor_2192" href="#Footnote_2192" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.”’</p>

</div>

<p>The cult thus summarized is not that of the Greek mythology,
much less that of the rationalized Stoic theology. It is the
primitive ritualism of Italy, still dear to the hearts of the
common people, and regaining its hold on the educated in
proportion as they spared themselves the effort of individual
criticism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State persecution.</div>

<p id="section453"><b>453.</b> It was by no mere accident that Marcus Aurelius
became the persecutor of the Christians. He was
at heart no successor of the Zeno who held as
essential the doctrine of a supreme deity, and absolutely rejected
the use of temples and images. In the interval, official Stoicism
had learnt first to tolerate superstition with a smile, next to
become its advocate; now it was to become a persecutor in its
name. Pontius Pilatus is said to have recognised the innocence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
of the founder of Christianity, and might have protected him
had his instructions from Rome allowed him to stretch his
authority so far; Gallio<a id="FNanchor_2193" href="#Footnote_2193" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> was uninterested in the preaching of
Paul; but Aurelius was acquainted with the Christian profession
and its adherents<a id="FNanchor_2194" href="#Footnote_2194" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>, and opposed it as an obstinate resistance to
authority<a id="FNanchor_2195" href="#Footnote_2195" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. The popular antipathy to the new religion, and
the official distaste for all disturbing novelties, found in him a
willing supporter<a id="FNanchor_2196" href="#Footnote_2196" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. Thus began a new struggle between the
power of the sword and that of inward conviction. Because
reason could not support the worship of the pagan deities,
violence must do so<a id="FNanchor_2197" href="#Footnote_2197" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. It became a triumph of the civil
authority and the popular will to extort a word of weakness by
two years of persistent torture<a id="FNanchor_2198" href="#Footnote_2198" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. No endowed professor or
enlightened magistrate raised his voice in protest; and in this
feeble acquiescence Stoicism perished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolt of the young Stoics.</div>

<p id="section454"><b>454.</b> For the consciences of the young revolted. Trained at
home and in school to believe in providence, in duty,
and in patient endurance of evil, they instinctively
recognised the Socratic force and example not in the magistrate
seated in his curule chair, nor in the rustic priest occupied in his
obsolete ritual, but in the teacher on the cross and the martyr on
the rack<a id="FNanchor_2199" href="#Footnote_2199" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. In ever increasing numbers men, who had from
their Stoic education imbibed the principles of the unity of the
Deity and the freedom of the will, came over to the new
society which professed the one without reservation, and displayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
the other without flinching. With them they brought in
large measure their philosophic habits of thought, and (in far
more particulars than is generally recognised) the definite tenets
which the Porch had always inculcated. Stoicism began a new
history, which is not yet ended, within the Christian church; and
we must now attempt to give some account of this aftergrowth
of the philosophy.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STOIC STRAIN IN CHRISTIANITY.</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Neighbours, but strangers.</div>

<p id="section455"><b>455.</b> During the first century and a half of the Christian era
Stoicism maintained an active and successful propaganda,
without becoming conscious that meanwhile
a new force was spreading in the Hellenic world which
was soon to challenge its own supremacy. There is no evidence
to show that any of the Stoic teachers with whom we have been
concerned knew anything of Christianity beyond the bare name,
until the two systems came into conflict in the time of Marcus
Aurelius; and it is in the highest degree improbable that any of
them were influenced in their opinions, directly or indirectly, by
the preaching of Christianity<a id="FNanchor_2200" href="#Footnote_2200" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. On the other hand the apostles
of the newer faith, as often as they entered any of the chief
cities of the Roman empire, met at once not only with the
professed adherents of Stoicism, but also with a still wider world
of educated men and women which was penetrated by Stoic
conceptions. From the first it was incumbent on Christian
teachers to define their attitude towards this philosophy; and it
is our purpose in this chapter to sketch shortly the manner in
which they did so. This task belongs primarily to the historian
of Christianity, but the present work would be incomplete without
some adumbration of this important field of study. From
the middle of the second century the relations between the two
systems alter in character: there then sets in a steady stream
of conversion by which the younger Stoics are drawn away
from the older creed, and carry over to its rival not only their
personal allegiance but also their intellectual equipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Common influences.</div>

<p id="section456"><b>456.</b> It is necessarily a difficult task to estimate the influence
of Stoicism upon the historical development of
Christianity, and it is impossible to do so without
trenching upon ground which is highly debateable. Upon
parallels between phrases used by Stoic and Christian writers
respectively not too much stress should be laid<a id="FNanchor_2201" href="#Footnote_2201" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Many of these
can be traced back to common sources from which each religion
drew in turn. From Persism the Stoic creed inherited much
through Heraclitus, and Christianity through Judaism. The
kindred doctrines of Buddhism and Cynism present themselves
to our view in Christianity in the Sermon on the mount, and
in Stoicism through the discourses of Epictetus. Individuals in
either camp were also influenced in varying degrees by a wave
of feeling in favour of asceticism and resignation which spread
over the whole Greco-Roman world about this time, resulting
from exaggerated attention being paid to the individual consciousness
at the cost of social and political life. We should therefore
endeavour to keep our eyes steadily fixed on the essential
features of Stoicism rather than on its details, and inquire how
these were regarded by Christian teachers in successive generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Progressive influence of Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section457"><b>457.</b> A starting-point is obviously afforded us by the speech
of St Paul upon Mars’ hill, in which he accepts a
verse from the Stoic poet Aratus<a id="FNanchor_2202" href="#Footnote_2202" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as a text upon
which to proclaim the fatherhood of God. This
Stoic doctrine (like many others to which he refers in his
writings) is treated by Paul as embodying an elementary truth,
and as a starting-point for fuller knowledge; from any other
point of view philosophy is regarded as a snare and an imposture<a id="FNanchor_2203" href="#Footnote_2203" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
A generation later we find that the editor of the
fourth gospel boldly places the Stoic version of the history of
creation in the forefront of his work<a id="FNanchor_2204" href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Later on in the second
century we find the doctrines of the double nature of the Christ
and of the variety inherent in the Deity becoming incorporated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
in technical Stoic forms as part of a defined Christian creed.
From whatever point we regard the Stoic influence, it appears
during this period as an increasing force. We shall speak of it
here as the ‘Stoic strain’ in Christianity; meaning by this that
a certain attitude of the intellect and sympathies, first developed
in Stoicism, found for itself a home in early Christianity; that
men, Stoics by inheritance or training, joined the church not
simply as disciples, but to a large extent as teachers also. This
point of view can perhaps best be explained by a sketch of the
development of Christian doctrine as it might be regarded by
fair-minded Stoics, attached to the principles of their philosophy
but suspicious of its close relations with the religion of the State,
and ready to welcome any new system which might appeal to
their reason as well as to their moral sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jesus from the Stoic standpoint.</div>

<p id="section458"><b>458.</b> A Stoic of the time of Vespasian (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 69 to 79) might
well be supposed to be made acquainted with the
beginnings of Christianity by some Christian friend.
The story he would hear would take the form of
one of those ‘oral gospels’ which are now generally supposed to
have preceded the shaping of the ‘gospels’ of our New Testament,
and to have corresponded generally to the common parts
of the first three gospels and some of the narratives of the
fourth<a id="FNanchor_2205" href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. He would thus learn that the founder was a Jew named
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, the son of Joseph a carpenter of Nazareth<a id="FNanchor_2206" href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. This
Jesus had in his childhood sat at the feet of the philosophic
Rabbis of Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_2207" href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, and had learnt from them to interpret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
the documents of Hebraism, ‘the law and the prophets,’ in the
sense of the world-religions, and by the principle of allegorism
to give a new and truer meaning to such parts of them as seemed
obsolete or incredible<a id="FNanchor_2208" href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. Upon reaching manhood he had been
shocked to find that the general body of the Pharisees, to which
his teachers belonged, was far more interested in maintaining
prejudices of race and class than in boldly proclaiming principles
of world-wide application; and that whilst freely avowing their
own opinions amongst friends, they held it indiscreet to reveal
them to the crowd<a id="FNanchor_2209" href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. After a period of prolonged reflection and
inward struggle<a id="FNanchor_2210" href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> he resolved on coming forward as a teacher in
his own name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The wise man.</div>

<p id="section459"><b>459.</b> At this point our Stoic would assuredly be impressed
by the ‘strength and force’ of character displayed
in the preaching of the young Jesus, and would so
far be disposed to rank him with Socrates and with Zeno. In
the content of Jesus’ teaching he would at once recognise some
of the prominent characteristics of Zeno’s <i>Republic</i>. For Jesus
too spoke of a model state, calling it the ‘kingdom of heaven’;
and in this state men of all nations were to find a place. Not
only the ceremonies of the old Hebrew religion, its sacrifices and
its sabbaths, were to be superseded<a id="FNanchor_2211" href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; the temple itself at
Jerusalem was to cease to be a place of worship<a id="FNanchor_2212" href="#Footnote_2212" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; the social and
economic system of the Jewish people was to be remodelled; the
rich were to be swept away, and the poor to enter into their
inheritance<a id="FNanchor_2213" href="#Footnote_2213" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. Men’s prayers were no longer to be offered to the
God of Abraham, but to the Father in heaven, surrounded by
spirits like those of Persism, the Name, the Will, the Kingdom,
the Glory and the Majesty<a id="FNanchor_2214" href="#Footnote_2214" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. That Jesus also spoke, after the
Persian fashion, of rewards for the good and the wicked in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
future existence might interest our Stoic less, but would not be
inconsistent with the traditions of his own sect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The emotions in Jesus.</div>

<p id="section460"><b>460.</b> Whilst recognising this strength of character and
sympathizing generally with the gospel message,
our Stoic could not fail to observe that the Christian
tradition did not claim for the Founder the imperturbable calm
which the wise man should under all circumstances possess.
From time to time his spirit was troubled<a id="FNanchor_2215" href="#Footnote_2215" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>; sometimes by
Anger, as when he denounced in turn the Pharisees, the scribes,
and the traders in the temple; sometimes by Pity, as when he
wept over Jerusalem; by Fear, as in the garden of Gethsemane<a id="FNanchor_2216" href="#Footnote_2216" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>;
then again by Shame, as in the meeting with the woman taken
in adultery<a id="FNanchor_2217" href="#Footnote_2217" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; and even by Hilarity, as when he participated
in the marriage revels at Cana. Yet perhaps, taking the character
as a whole, a Stoic would not be surprised that the disciples
should remember only the sweetness, the patience, and the
perseverance of their master; that they should account him a
perfect man<a id="FNanchor_2218" href="#Footnote_2218" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, attributing his faults to the weakness of the
body<a id="FNanchor_2219" href="#Footnote_2219" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, and not to any taint of soul; and finally that they
should accept him as their Lord and their God<a id="FNanchor_2220" href="#Footnote_2220" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. For all these
points of view, without being specifically Stoic, find some kind
of recognition within Stoicism itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mythologic Christianity.</div>

<p id="section461"><b>461.</b> But as our inquirer proceeded to trace the history of
Christianity after its Founder’s death, he would soon
find the beginnings of division within the Christian
body. He would learn, for instance, that the Christians of
Jerusalem, who even during their Master’s lifetime had been
puzzled by his condemnation of Hebrew traditions, had quickly
relapsed upon his death into the ways of thinking to which in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
their childhood they had been accustomed. They had become
once more Hebrews, and even ardent advocates of an obsolete
ceremonialism; and in this respect they seemed entirely to have
forgotten the teaching of their Founder. But their allegiance to
his person was unshakeable; and they cherished the conviction
that during the lifetime of most of them he would rejoin them,
and establish that earthly kingdom which in their hearts they
had never ceased to covet. In view of this imminent revolution,
quite as much as out of respect for the teaching of the Sermon
on the mount, they encouraged their members to spend their
savings on immediate necessities, and soon fell into dire poverty.
To Christianity as an intellectual system they contributed
nothing; ‘little children’ at heart<a id="FNanchor_2221" href="#Footnote_2221" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, they were content to live in
a perfect affection one towards another, and their miserable
circumstances were cheered by visions of angels and a sense of
their master’s continual presence<a id="FNanchor_2222" href="#Footnote_2222" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. From this company our
Stoic might easily turn aside as from a band of ignorant fanatics,
displaying the same simplicity and conservatism as the idol-worshippers
of Rome, with the added mischief of being disloyal
towards the majesty of the empire, and a possible danger to its
security<a id="FNanchor_2223" href="#Footnote_2223" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philosophic Christians.</div>

<p id="section462"><b>462.</b> In startling contrast to this band of simple-minded
brethren would appear the Christian propagandists
whose temper is revealed to us in the latter part of
the book of Acts, in the epistles of Paul, the first epistle of Peter,
and the epistle to the Hebrews. These fiery preachers, equally
attached to the name of their Lord, might appear to have been
singularly indifferent to his person and his history, and even to
have paid little heed to the details of his teaching as recorded in
the oral gospels<a id="FNanchor_2224" href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>. But they were entirely possessed by his
secret—the transmutation of Hebraism into a world-religion;
and they had an ardent desire to present it to the Roman world
in a form that would win intellectual assent. Into this effort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
they threw their whole personality; all the conceptions which
filled their minds, some of them childish and common to them
with uncivilised peoples, others derived from Jewish tradition or
Hellenistic philosophy, were crudely but forcibly fused in the
determination to present ‘the Christ’ to the world, as the solution
of its difficulties and the centre of its hopes. The outpourings of
these men were as unintelligible and unsympathetic to the
fraternity at Jerusalem as they are to the average church-goer
to-day; only breaking out here and there into the flame of clear
expression when at last some long-sought conception had been
grasped<a id="FNanchor_2225" href="#Footnote_2225" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. Of such preachers St Paul is for us the type, and we
may describe them as the ‘Paulists.’ Paul himself is self-assertive
in tone, as a man may be who feels himself misunderstood
and misjudged in his own circle<a id="FNanchor_2226" href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. But an ardent Stoic
might well have recognised in him a kindred spirit, an intellect
grappling boldly with the supreme problems, and laying the
foundations of a new philosophy of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St Paul and Stoicism.</div>

<p id="section463"><b>463.</b> <span class="smcap">Paul</span> was a man of Jewish descent, intensely proud of
his nationality; but nevertheless brought up in the
city of Tarsus, which had for centuries been a centre
of Hellenistic philosophy of every type<a id="FNanchor_2227" href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, and more especially of
Stoicism<a id="FNanchor_2228" href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. This philosophy is to Paul’s mind entirely inadequate
and even dangerous; nevertheless he is steeped in Stoic ways of
thinking, which are continually asserting themselves in his
teaching without being formally recognised by him as such.
Thus the ‘universe’ (κόσμος), which to the Stoic includes everything
with which he is concerned, and in particular the subject-matter
of religion, becomes with Paul the ‘world,’ that out of
which and above which the Christian rises to the ‘eternal’ or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
spiritual life.’ Yet this contrast is not final<a id="FNanchor_2229" href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; and whether or
not the Pauline ‘spirit’ is derived from the Stoic πνεῦμα, the
Pauline system, as it is elaborated in detail, increasingly accommodates
itself to that of the Stoics. Our supposed inquirer
would examine the points both of likeness and of contrast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Paulist logic.</div>

<p id="section464"><b>464.</b> The teaching of Paul was, like that of the Stoics,
positive and dogmatic<a id="FNanchor_2230" href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. He accepted unquestioningly
the evidence of the senses as trustworthy,
without troubling himself as to the possibility of hallucinations,
from which nevertheless his circle was not free<a id="FNanchor_2231" href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. He also
accepted the theory of ‘inborn ideas,’ that is, of moral principles
engraved upon the heart<a id="FNanchor_2232" href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; and for the faculty of the soul which
realizes such principles he uses the special term ‘conscience’
(συνείδησις)<a id="FNanchor_2233" href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>; conscience being described, with a correct sense of
etymology and possibly a touch of humour, as that within a man
which becomes a second witness to what the man says<a id="FNanchor_2234" href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. From
another point of view the conscience is the divine spirit at work
in the human spirit<a id="FNanchor_2235" href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. Closely associated with conscience in the
Pauline system is ‘faith’ (πίστις), a faculty of the soul which properly
has to do with things not as they are, but as we mean them
to be<a id="FNanchor_2236" href="#Footnote_2236" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. The Stoic logic had failed to indicate clearly how from
the knowledge of the universe as it is men could find a basis for
their hopes and efforts for its future; the missing criterion is
supplied by the Paulist doctrine of ‘faith,’ which may also be
paradoxically described as the power always to say ‘Yes<a id="FNanchor_2237" href="#Footnote_2237" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.’ The
fraternity at Jerusalem appear to have been alarmed not so
much at the principle of faith, as at the manner in which St Paul
used it to enforce his own doctrines; we find them by way of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
contrast asserting the Academic position that ‘none of us are
infallible<a id="FNanchor_2238" href="#Footnote_2238" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.’ We may here notice that the next generation of
Christians again brought the theory of faith into harmony with
Stoic principles, by explaining that the power of knowing the
right is strictly dependent upon right action<a id="FNanchor_2239" href="#Footnote_2239" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paulist metaphysics.</div>

<p id="section465"><b>465.</b> In their metaphysical postulates the Paulists started,
like all ancient philosophers, with the contrast
between soul and body, but this they transformed
into that between ‘spirit’ and ‘flesh.’ To them the ‘spirit’
included the whole message of Christianity, the ‘flesh’ the
doctrine and practice of the Gentile world<a id="FNanchor_2240" href="#Footnote_2240" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. The terms themselves
were in use in the oral gospel<a id="FNanchor_2241" href="#Footnote_2241" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, but the Paulists developed
the content of ‘spirit,’ until it included a whole world of conceptions,
encircling and interfused with the world of sense-experience.
But Paul did not desire that this spiritual world
should be regarded as wanting in reality, or as a mere product
of the imagination: and to express this objectivity of spirit he
adopted the Stoic term ‘body.’ Body then expresses the underlying
monistic principle of all nature; and we may say ‘spirit-body’
exists<a id="FNanchor_2242" href="#Footnote_2242" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, with the same confidence with which we speak of
animal body or ‘flesh-body.’ There has been a flesh-body of
Jesus; with that we have no more concern<a id="FNanchor_2243" href="#Footnote_2243" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. There exists
eternally a spirit-body of Christ; from that his church draws its
life. The Christian feeds upon the spirit of his Master; but in
paradoxical phrase we may say that he eats his body and drinks
his blood<a id="FNanchor_2244" href="#Footnote_2244" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. What is not ‘body’ has no real existence at all<a id="FNanchor_2245" href="#Footnote_2245" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Christian universe.</div>

<p id="section466"><b>466.</b> St Paul in his letters appears entirely lacking in that
reverent feeling towards the physical universe, that
admiration for sun, moon and stars, which marked
the earlier world-religions, and which he perhaps associated with
Babylonian idolatry. As we have seen, he only used the Stoic
term for universe in disapproval. And yet the conception of the
history of the universe was deeply impressed upon the Paulists,
and almost precisely in Stoic form. God, the Father, is the
beginning of all things; from him they come, and to him they
shall all return<a id="FNanchor_2246" href="#Footnote_2246" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. From the Father went forth an image of
him<a id="FNanchor_2247" href="#Footnote_2247" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, his first-born Son<a id="FNanchor_2248" href="#Footnote_2248" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, his word, the Christ; by this he
created the world, and for this the world exists<a id="FNanchor_2249" href="#Footnote_2249" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. By a further
outpouring of the divine spirit, men are created with the capacity
of becoming the ‘images’ or bodily representations of God and
his Son<a id="FNanchor_2250" href="#Footnote_2250" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. To this general doctrine individual Paulists add
special features; St Paul himself introduces ‘woman’ as a fourth
order of creation, an image or ‘vessel’ bearing the same relation
to man as man to Christ<a id="FNanchor_2251" href="#Footnote_2251" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>; and a writer (of distinctly later date)
seems to refer not only to the creation of the elements<a id="FNanchor_2252" href="#Footnote_2252" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, but also
to their coming destruction by the conflagration<a id="FNanchor_2253" href="#Footnote_2253" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Of the
creation of the animals no notice is taken<a id="FNanchor_2254" href="#Footnote_2254" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The divine immanence.</div>

<p id="section467"><b>467.</b> From this theory of creation it would seem to follow
as a consequence that the world is inhabited by
the Deity, and is essentially good. This is the
Stoic doctrine, and it is accepted boldly by Paul. God dwells
in the universe, and the universe in him; man is not in the strict
sense an individual, for apart from God he does not exist at all<a id="FNanchor_2255" href="#Footnote_2255" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.
But there nevertheless remains the fact of the existence of evil,
both physical and moral, in apparent defiance of the divine will.
Here too the Paulists agree with Stoic teaching; they hold that
evil serves a moral purpose as a training in virtue<a id="FNanchor_2256" href="#Footnote_2256" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; that God
turns evil to his own purpose, so that in the final issue all things
are working together for good<a id="FNanchor_2257" href="#Footnote_2257" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>; that God is active through his
Word in restoring a unity that has been for a time broken<a id="FNanchor_2258" href="#Footnote_2258" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.
Neither can man shift on to his Maker the responsibility for
his own wrongdoing; that is (as Cleanthes had taught before)
the work of men following out their own ways in accordance
with some bias which is in conflict with their divine origin<a id="FNanchor_2259" href="#Footnote_2259" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. In
spite of all this common ground Paul maintains with at least
equal emphasis doctrines of a gloomier type. The universe, as
it is, is evil; its rulers are the powers of darkness<a id="FNanchor_2260" href="#Footnote_2260" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. St Paul by
no means put out of sight, as the Stoics did, the doctrine
of an Evil Spirit; on the contrary, this conception dominates
his mind and multiplies itself in it. Sin in particular is in
his eyes more widespread, more hideous, more dangerous than
it is to the Stoic philosopher. To this point we must revert
later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Religion.</div>

<p id="section468"><b>468.</b> With regard to religious belief and practice (we are here
using the word ‘religion’ in the narrower sense, as
in the previous chapter on this subject) Paul was
in the first place a monotheist, and addresses his prayers and
praises alike to the Father in heaven, and to him alone. At
the same time he does not regard the Deity as dwelling in a
world apart; he is to be worshipped in and through the Christ,
who is the point of contact between him and humanity<a id="FNanchor_2261" href="#Footnote_2261" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. From
the ceremonial practices of Hebraism all the Paulists break
away completely. Its bloody sacrifices take away no sin<a id="FNanchor_2262" href="#Footnote_2262" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; the
solemn rite of circumcision is nothing in itself<a id="FNanchor_2263" href="#Footnote_2263" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, and in practice
it is an impediment to the acceptance of Christ<a id="FNanchor_2264" href="#Footnote_2264" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. The disposition
to observe days and seasons, sabbaths and new moons, is
a matter for serious alarm<a id="FNanchor_2265" href="#Footnote_2265" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. In place of this ritualism is to be
substituted ‘a worship according to reason<a id="FNanchor_2266" href="#Footnote_2266" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>,’ which is in close
agreement with Stoic practice. To think rightly of the Deity<a id="FNanchor_2267" href="#Footnote_2267" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,
to give thanks to him<a id="FNanchor_2268" href="#Footnote_2268" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, to honour him by an innocent life<a id="FNanchor_2269" href="#Footnote_2269" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, is
well pleasing to God; and the writings of Paul, like those of
Epictetus, include many a hymn of praise, and show us the
existence at this time of the beginnings of a great body of
religious poetry<a id="FNanchor_2270" href="#Footnote_2270" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Human nature.</div>

<p id="section469"><b>469.</b> In the analysis of human nature Paul again started
from the Stoic basis. In the first place he recognised
the fundamental unity of the man as a compacted
whole<a id="FNanchor_2271" href="#Footnote_2271" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>; subject to this monism, he recognised three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
parts, the spirit, the animal life, and the flesh<a id="FNanchor_2272" href="#Footnote_2272" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Of these only
the two extremes, the spirit and the flesh, are usually mentioned;
but these do not strictly correspond to the traditional
distinction of soul and body. The soul (ψυχή, <i>anima</i>) is that
which man has in common with the animals; the spirit (πνεῦμα,
<i>spiritus</i>) is that which he has in common with God. Where
therefore only two parts are mentioned, the soul and the flesh
must be considered both to be included under the name ‘flesh.’
Soul and flesh are peculiar to the individual man; spirit is the
common possession of the Deity and of all men<a id="FNanchor_2273" href="#Footnote_2273" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. Thus God
and man share in the spiritual nature, and become partners in
an aspect of the universe from which animals, plants, and stones
are definitely excluded<a id="FNanchor_2274" href="#Footnote_2274" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>. The ‘spirit’ of St Paul therefore
corresponds closely to the ‘principate’ of the Stoics, and though
the Christian apostle does not lay the same emphasis on its
intellectual aspect, he fully recognises that the spiritual life is
true wisdom, and its perversion folly and darkness<a id="FNanchor_2275" href="#Footnote_2275" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resurrection and immortality.</div>

<p id="section470"><b>470.</b> From this analysis of human nature Paul approaches
the central doctrine of the Christian community,
that of the resurrection of its Founder. To the
simple-minded fraternity at Jerusalem the resurrection
of Jesus was a marvel, an interference with the orderly
course of divine providence, a proof of the truth of the gospel
message. Jesus has returned to his disciples in the body as he
lived; he has again departed, but before this generation has
passed away he will return to stay with them and establish his
kingdom. To St Paul all this is different. He accepts implicitly
the fact of the resurrection, but as typical, not as abnormal.
As Christ has risen, so will his followers rise. But Christ lives
in the spirit; by their intrinsic nature neither the flesh-body
nor the soul-body can become immortal<a id="FNanchor_2276" href="#Footnote_2276" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. And in the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
Christ’s followers are joined with him, and will be more fully
joined when they are rid of the burden of the flesh<a id="FNanchor_2277" href="#Footnote_2277" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. This
continued existence is no mere fancy; it is real, objective, and
(in philosophical language) bodily. Though by the creation all
men have some share in the divine spirit, yet immortality (at
any rate in the full sense) is the privilege of the faithful only; it
is won, not inherited. Paul does not venture to suggest that
human individuality and personality are retained in the life
beyond. He draws no picture of the reunion of preacher and
disciple, of husband and wife, or of mother and child. It is
enough for him to believe that he will be reunited with the
glorified Christ, and be in some sense a member of the heavenly
community<a id="FNanchor_2278" href="#Footnote_2278" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The seed theory.</div>

<p id="section471"><b>471.</b> On its philosophical side the Paulist view of immortality
is closely akin to the Stoic, and is exposed
to the same charge of logical inconsistency. If the
whole man is one, how can we cut off the flesh-body and the
soul-body from this unity, and yet maintain that the spirit-body
is not also destroyed? To meet this difficulty St Paul, in one
of his grandest outbursts of conviction, propounds the doctrine
of ‘seeds,’ closely connected with the Stoic doctrine of seed-powers’
(σπερματικοὶ λόγοι)<a id="FNanchor_2279" href="#Footnote_2279" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, and with the general principles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
biological science as now understood. This seed is the true
reality in man; it may throw off both soul and flesh, and assume
to itself a new body, as a tree from which the branches are
lopped off will throw out new branches. Thus, and not otherwise,
was Christ raised; and as Christ was raised, so will his
followers be raised<a id="FNanchor_2280" href="#Footnote_2280" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. Man is not in any final sense a unit; as
the race is continued by the breaking off of the seed from the
individual, so is the spirit-life won by the abandonment of soul
and flesh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life and death.</div>

<p id="section472"><b>472.</b> At this point we are brought face to face with a very
old paradox, that life is death, and death is life.
What is commonly called life is that of the soul
and the flesh, which the animals share and which may mean
the atrophy of man’s higher part; on the other hand death
has no power over the life of the spirit, which is therefore called
‘eternal life’ or ‘life of the ages.’ To enter upon this ‘eternal
life’ is the very kernel of the gospel message<a id="FNanchor_2281" href="#Footnote_2281" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>; in the language of
philosophy it is the bridge between physics and ethics. Although
the steps by which it is reached can be most clearly traced in
the Pauline epistles, yet the general conclusion was accepted by
the whole Christian church. From this point of view Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, by virtue of their communion with God, are
still alive<a id="FNanchor_2282" href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>; he who holds his life dear, loses it; and he who
makes it of no account keeps it to the life of the ages<a id="FNanchor_2283" href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>; he who
listens to the teaching of Jesus and believes in the Father who
sent him, has passed over out of death into life<a id="FNanchor_2284" href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral principles.</div>

<p id="section473"><b>473.</b> From the doctrine of ‘eternal life’ follow the first
principles of morals: eternal life is the moral end
(τέλος) or <i>summum bonum</i><a id="FNanchor_2285" href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. The spirit is everything,
the act nothing; good lies in the intention, not in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
performance<a id="FNanchor_2286" href="#Footnote_2286" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>; we are saved by faith, not by works<a id="FNanchor_2287" href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. Therefore
all <i>tabus</i> fall away; ‘to the pure everything is pure<a id="FNanchor_2288" href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>’; ‘in
its own nature no food is impure; but if people regard any food
as impure, to them it is<a id="FNanchor_2289" href="#Footnote_2289" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>’; ‘our ungraceful parts come to have a
more abundant grace<a id="FNanchor_2290" href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>’; ‘everything that God has created is
good<a id="FNanchor_2291" href="#Footnote_2291" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.’ And because God and all men share in one spirit, all
men are fellow-citizens in the cosmopolis<a id="FNanchor_2292" href="#Footnote_2292" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. To this St Paul
sacrifices all personal advantages of which otherwise he might
be justly proud, his Hebrew descent, his free citizenship in the
Roman empire, and even his standing in sex above an inferior
part of the creation<a id="FNanchor_2293" href="#Footnote_2293" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. The spiritual condition is expressed in
terms of certain emotional attitudes which correspond to the
three Stoic ‘constancies<a id="FNanchor_2294" href="#Footnote_2294" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>’; the details vary, but love, joy, peace,
gentleness and sweet reasonableness<a id="FNanchor_2295" href="#Footnote_2295" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> are frequently recurring
terms, whilst faith, hope and love are recommended in one
passage of the highest eloquence, love (ἀγάπη, <i>caritas</i>) being
given the highest place of all<a id="FNanchor_2296" href="#Footnote_2296" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Virtues and vices.</div>

<p id="section474"><b>474.</b> In the treatment of the virtues and vices we miss the
familiar series of the four virtues, though three of
them find a place here or there in some more
elaborate list<a id="FNanchor_2297" href="#Footnote_2297" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. The vices are treated with much more fulness.
Those connected with the sexual relations and functions are
invariably the first to be condemned; incest, adultery, harlotry,
foul conversation, are named in almost every list<a id="FNanchor_2298" href="#Footnote_2298" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. Next in
importance are ill-feeling and quarrelsomeness; heavy drinking
comes after these. More upon Stoic lines is the reproof of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
‘excessive grief<a id="FNanchor_2299" href="#Footnote_2299" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.’ The necessity of steady progress is strongly
pressed, and the term used (προκοπή) is that with which we are
familiar in Greek philosophy<a id="FNanchor_2300" href="#Footnote_2300" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. In all the Paulist writers there
is also incessant insistence upon the importance of the regular
performance of daily duties<a id="FNanchor_2301" href="#Footnote_2301" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. Experience not only of the
disasters which befel the church at Jerusalem, but also of similar
tendencies nearer at hand, had impressed deeply on Paul the
insufficiency of moral teaching which relied on general principles
and emotional feeling only, especially if such teaching (as in the
Sermon on the mount) was mainly negative. The Paulists at
any rate set forth, almost in a fixed form, a body of instructions
to serve the community as a whole, and social<a id="FNanchor_2302" href="#Footnote_2302" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> rather than
ethical in nature. This teaching follows closely the Stoic teaching
of the same period, and is based upon the relationships
(σχέσεις), such as those of king and subject, master and slave,
husband and wife, parent and child<a id="FNanchor_2303" href="#Footnote_2303" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. It is conservative in
character, advocating kindness, contentment, and zeal in social
relations as they exist. Thus whilst we recognise the spirit of
Zeno in the Sermon on the mount, we find that of Panaetius in
the Pauiist discourses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sage and saint.</div>

<p id="section475"><b>475.</b> As against the Stoic sage the Paulists set up as their
ideal the saint, and used all the resources of
eloquence in his commendation. He is the true
king and priest<a id="FNanchor_2304" href="#Footnote_2304" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>; even if he is a beggar, he is surpassingly
rich<a id="FNanchor_2305" href="#Footnote_2305" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>; he alone, though a slave, is free<a id="FNanchor_2306" href="#Footnote_2306" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. On the other hand
the sinner is always a slave<a id="FNanchor_2307" href="#Footnote_2307" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>; even his good acts are without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
real value<a id="FNanchor_2308" href="#Footnote_2308" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. All such phrases would be familiar to our Stoic
inquirer; but perhaps he might be specially impressed by finding
once more the doctrine of the ‘sufficiency of virtue’ amongst
the Christians. The term is indeed altered<a id="FNanchor_2309" href="#Footnote_2309" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>, but it bears the
same meaning as regards independence of wealth, health and
liberty, though with more emphasis upon support from a divine
source.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St Paul and sin.</div>

<p id="section476"><b>476.</b> It is generally agreed that in the writings of St Paul
there is displayed a special sense of shame and
horror in speaking of sin<a id="FNanchor_2310" href="#Footnote_2310" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>, which entirely differentiates
his teaching from that of the Stoics. This difference,
however, cannot be due to St Paul treating sin as ‘defiance
towards a loving Father<a id="FNanchor_2311" href="#Footnote_2311" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>,’ for this view was also that of
Cleanthes and the Stoics generally; and Paul’s horror of sin
depends on no reasoning, but is felt by him as instinctive. It
remains to add that our Stoic inquirer would find an apparent
conflict between this instinct and Paul’s reasoning. The sin
of which St Paul finds it ‘a shame even to speak<a id="FNanchor_2312" href="#Footnote_2312" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>’ is sexual;
and so far as it consists in abnormal social habits, such as those
relations between persons of the same sex which had found
excuse in the classical world, the Stoic would at once agree that
these practices were ‘against nature<a id="FNanchor_2313" href="#Footnote_2313" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>’ and were unseemly. Again,
the marriage of near relations, though not against nature in the
sense in which nature is illustrated by the animal world, is still
opposed to so deep-seated a social tradition as to merit instinctive
condemnation<a id="FNanchor_2314" href="#Footnote_2314" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. But the instincts of St Paul go far
deeper; the marriage relation is to him at the best a concession
to human frailty, and falls short of the ideal<a id="FNanchor_2315" href="#Footnote_2315" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. Nor is this
merely a personal view of Paul; it is deeply impressed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
the consciousness of the whole Christian church. How, it would
be asked, can this be reconciled with the abolition of the <i>tabu</i>,
with the principle that ‘all things are pure,’ or even with the
obvious purpose of the Creator when he created mankind male
and female?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sex tabus.</div>

<p id="section477"><b>477.</b> It would seem that here we have touched a fundamental
point in the historical development of the moral
sentiments. The sexual <i>tabus</i> are the most primitive
and deeply-seated in human history. From this point of view
woman is by nature impure, the sex-functions which play so
large a part in her mature life being to the savage both dangerous
and abhorrent. Hence the view, so strongly held by St Paul,
that woman as a part of the creation is inferior to man. But
man too becomes by his sex-functions impure, though for shorter
periods; and by union with woman lowers himself to her level.
Hence the unconquerable repugnance of St Paul to the sexual
relation under any conditions whatever<a id="FNanchor_2316" href="#Footnote_2316" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>; a repugnance which
reason and religion keep within limits<a id="FNanchor_2317" href="#Footnote_2317" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>, but which yet always
breaks out afresh in his writings. Hence also he assumes as
unquestionable the natural unseemliness of the sexual parts of
the body; in all these points not going beyond feelings which
are to-day as keen as ever, though no philosopher has found it
easy to justify them. But in certain points St Paul outpaces the
general feeling, and shows himself an extreme reactionary
against the philosophic doctrines which he shared with the Stoic.
He extends his dislike, in accordance with a most primitive
<i>tabu</i>, to woman’s hair<a id="FNanchor_2318" href="#Footnote_2318" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>; he desires the subordination of
woman to man to be marked in her outward appearance<a id="FNanchor_2319" href="#Footnote_2319" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>;
and he forbids women to speak in the general meetings of
church members<a id="FNanchor_2320" href="#Footnote_2320" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Hebrew feeling.</div>

<p id="section478"><b>478.</b> This intense feeling on the part of St Paul required,
as his writings assume, no justification; it was
therefore an inherited feeling, as familiar to many
an Oriental as it is usually strange and unsympathetic to the
ancient and modern European. It appears also to be rooted in
Hebrew tradition; for if we are at liberty to interpret the myth
of Adam and Eve by the parallel of Yama and Yamī in the
Rigveda<a id="FNanchor_2321" href="#Footnote_2321" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, the fall of man was nothing else than the first
marriage, in which Eve was the suitor and Adam the accomplice.
In the dramatic poem of the Rigveda Yama corresponds to the
Hebrew Adam, his sister Yamī to Eve<a id="FNanchor_2322" href="#Footnote_2322" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. Yamī yearns to
become the mother of the human race; Yama shudders at the
impiety of a sister’s embrace. Zeno had already conceived the
world-problem in much the same shape<a id="FNanchor_2323" href="#Footnote_2323" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>; but to the Oriental
it is more than a problem of cosmology; it is the fundamental
opposition of sex attitude, the woman who longs for the family
affections against the man who seeks an ideal purity. In
Genesis the prohibition of the apple appears at first sight
colourless, yet the meaning is hardly obscure. After touching
the forbidden fruit man and woman first feel the shame of
nakedness; and Eve is punished by the coming pains of child-bearing,
and a rank below her husband’s. None the less she has
her wish, for she becomes the mother of all living. It is hard
to think that Paul, who always traces human sin back to the
offence of Adam, and finds it most shamelessly displayed in the
sex-relationships of his own time, could have conceived of the
Fall in any very different way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The taint in procreation.</div>

<p id="section479"><b>479.</b> According then to a point of view which we believe to
be latent in all the teaching of Paul on the subject
of sin, the original taint lay in procreation, and
through the begetting of children has passed on from one
generation of mankind to another; ‘through the succession
from Adam all men become dead<a id="FNanchor_2324" href="#Footnote_2324" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.’ As an ethical standpoint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
this position is very alien from Stoicism; with the Stoic it is
a first law of nature which bids all men seek for the continuance
of the race; with the Apostle the same yearning leads them to
enter the pathway of death. It would lead us too far to attempt
here to discuss this profound moral problem, which has deeply
influenced the whole history of the Christian church. We are
however greatly concerned with the influence of this sentiment
on Pauline doctrine. For it follows that in order to attain to
a true moral or spiritual life man needs a new begetting and
a new birth<a id="FNanchor_2325" href="#Footnote_2325" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>; he must become a son of God through the outpouring
of his spirit<a id="FNanchor_2326" href="#Footnote_2326" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. This is one of the most familiar of
Pauline conceptions, and for us it is easy to link it on to the
Stoico-Pauline account of the creation, according to which man
was in the first instance created through the Word of God, and
endowed with his spirit. But to the community at Jerusalem
all conceptions of this kind appear to have been hardly intelligible,
and tended to aggravate the deep distrust of the
teachings and methods of St Paul and his companions, which
was rooted in his disregard of national tradition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The quarrel.</div>

<p id="section480"><b>480.</b> This difference of mental attitude soon broke out into
an open quarrel. So much was inevitable; and the
fact that the quarrel is recorded at length in the
texts from which we are quoting is one of the strongest evidences
of their general accuracy. The Christians at Jerusalem formed
themselves into a nationalist party; they claimed that all the
brothers should be in the first instance conformists to Hebrew
institutions. Paul went up to Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_2327" href="#Footnote_2327" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, eager to argue the
matter with men of famous name. He was disillusioned, as is
so often the traveller who returns after trying experiences and
much mental growth to the home to which his heart still clings.
Peter and the others had no arguments to meet Paul’s; he could
learn nothing from them<a id="FNanchor_2328" href="#Footnote_2328" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>; they had not even a consistent
practice<a id="FNanchor_2329" href="#Footnote_2329" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. At first Paul’s moral sense was outraged; he
publicly rebuked Peter as double-faced. After a little time he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
realized that he had met with children; he remembered that he
had once thought and acted in the same way<a id="FNanchor_2330" href="#Footnote_2330" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. Jews in heart,
the home apostles still talked of marvels<a id="FNanchor_2331" href="#Footnote_2331" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, still yearned for the
return of Jesus in the flesh<a id="FNanchor_2332" href="#Footnote_2332" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. A philosophic religion was as
much beyond their grasp as a consistent morality. Through
a simple-minded application of the doctrines of the Sermon on
the mount they had slipped into deep poverty<a id="FNanchor_2333" href="#Footnote_2333" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>; they were ready
to give Paul full recognition in return for charitable help. This
was not refused them; but to his other teaching Paul now added
a chapter on pecuniary independence<a id="FNanchor_2334" href="#Footnote_2334" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>; and in his old age he
left to his successors warnings against ‘old wives’ fables<a id="FNanchor_2335" href="#Footnote_2335" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>’ and
‘Jewish legends<a id="FNanchor_2336" href="#Footnote_2336" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The development of Christian mythology.</div>

<p id="section481"><b>481.</b> Thus for the first time the forces of mythology within
the Christian church clashed with those of philosophy.
For the moment Paul appeared to be the
victor; he won the formal recognition of the church,
with full authority to continue his preaching on the understanding
that it was primarily directed to the Gentile world<a id="FNanchor_2337" href="#Footnote_2337" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.
External events were also unfavourable to the Hebraists: the
destruction of Jerusalem deprived them of their local centre;
the failure of Jesus to reappear in the flesh within the lifetime
of his companions disappointed them of their most cherished
hope. But their sentiments and thoughts remained to a great
extent unchanged. To Paul they gave their respect, to Peter
their love; and the steady tradition of the Christian church has
confirmed this judgment. No saint has been so loved as Peter;
to none have so many churches been dedicated by the affectionate
instinct of the many; whilst even the dominant position of Paul
in the sacred canon has hardly secured him much more than
formal recognition except by the learned. So again it was with
Paul’s teaching; formally recognised as orthodox, it remained
misunderstood and unappreciated: it was even rapidly converted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span>
into that mythological form to which Paul himself was so fiercely
opposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Virgin birth and the resurrection.</div>

<p id="section482"><b>482.</b> This divergence of view is illustrated most strikingly
in the two doctrines which for both parties were
the cardinal points of Christian belief, the divine
nature of the Founder and his resurrection. On
the latter point the standpoint of the Hebraists is sufficiently
indicated by the tradition of the gospels, all of which emphatically
record as a decisive fact that the body of Jesus was not found in
his grave on the third day; to the Paulists this point is entirely
irrelevant, and they pass it by unmentioned<a id="FNanchor_2338" href="#Footnote_2338" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. To Paul again
the man Jesus was of human and natural birth, born of the
posterity of David, born of a woman, born subject to the law<a id="FNanchor_2339" href="#Footnote_2339" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>;
in his aspect as the Christ he was, as his followers were to be,
begotten of the spirit and born anew<a id="FNanchor_2340" href="#Footnote_2340" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. His statement as to
descent from David (which hardly means more than that he was
of Jewish race) was crystallized by the mythologists in two
formal genealogies, which disagree so entirely in detail that they
have always been the despair of verbal apologists, but agree in
tracing the pedigree through Joseph to Jesus. The phrase
‘begotten of the spirit’ was interpreted with equal literalness;
but the marvel-lovers were for a time puzzled to place the
‘spirit’ in the family relationship. In the first instance the
spirit seems to have been identified with the mother of Jesus<a id="FNanchor_2341" href="#Footnote_2341" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>;
but the misunderstanding of a Hebrew word which does not
necessarily connote physical virginity<a id="FNanchor_2342" href="#Footnote_2342" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> assisted to fix the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
function of fatherhood upon the divine parent. The antipathy
to the natural process of procreation which we have traced in
St Paul himself, and which was surely not less active amongst
many of the Hebraists, has contributed to raise this materialisation
of a philosophic tenet to a high place amongst the formal
dogmas of historic Christianity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of the Word.</div>

<p id="section483"><b>483.</b> But if the tendency to myth-making was still alive in
the Christian church, that in the direction of
philosophy had become self-confident and active.
The Paulists had taken the measure of their former opponents;
they felt themselves superior in intellectual and moral vigour,
and they knew that they had won this superiority by contact
with the Gentile world. More than before they applied themselves
to plead the cause of the Christ before the Gentiles; but
the storm and stress of the Pauline epistles gave way in time to
a serener atmosphere, in which the truths of Stoicism were more
generously acknowledged. A Stoic visitor of the reign of
Trajan would meet in Christian circles the attitude represented
to us by the fourth gospel, in which the problem of the Christ-nature
stands to the front, and is treated on consistently Stoic
lines. St Paul had spoken of Jesus as ‘for us a wisdom which
is from God<a id="FNanchor_2343" href="#Footnote_2343" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>’ and had asserted that ‘from the beginning he
had the nature of God<a id="FNanchor_2344" href="#Footnote_2344" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>’; his successors declared frankly that
Christ was the Logos, the Word<a id="FNanchor_2345" href="#Footnote_2345" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>; and in place of the myth of
the Virgin Birth they deliberately set in the beginning of their
account of Christ the foundation-principles of Stoic physics
and the Paulist account of the spiritual procreation of all
Christians.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came
into being through him, and apart from him nothing that exists came into
being<a id="FNanchor_2346" href="#Footnote_2346" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.’</p>

<p>‘To all who have received him, to them—that is, to those who trust in his
name—he has given the privilege of becoming children of God; who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
begotten as such not by human descent, nor through an impulse of their own
nature, nor through the will of a human father, but from God.</p>

<p>‘And the Word came in the flesh, and lived for a time in our midst, so
that we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father’s only Son, sent from his
presence. He was full of grace and truth<a id="FNanchor_2347" href="#Footnote_2347" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>The Stoic character of this teaching is no longer latent, but
proclaimed; and the Church Fathers recognise this in no
doubtful terms<a id="FNanchor_2348" href="#Footnote_2348" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The doctrine of the Trinity.</div>

<p id="section484"><b>484.</b> During the whole of the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> men
trained in Stoic principles crowded into the Christian
community. Within it they felt they had a special
work to do in building up Christian doctrine so
that it might face all storms of criticism. This effort gradually
took the shape of schools modelled upon those of the philosophic
sects. Such a school was founded by an ex-Stoic named
<span class="smcap">Pantaenus</span> at Alexandria in 181 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>; and his successors
<span class="smcap">Clemens</span> of Alexandria (ob. c. 215 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) and <span class="smcap">Origenes</span>
(c. 186-253 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) specially devoted themselves to developing the
theory of the divine nature upon Stoic lines. Not all the
particulars they suggested were accepted by the general feeling
of the Christian body, but from the discussion was developed
gradually the ecclesiastical doctrine of the Trinity<a id="FNanchor_2349" href="#Footnote_2349" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. The
elements of this doctrine have been already traced in St Paul’s
epistles, in which the dominating conceptions are those of God
the Father, the Christ, and the divine spirit. For these in the
next generation we find the Father, the Word, and the Spirit;
and the last term of the triad becomes increasingly identified
with the ‘holy spirit’ of Stoicism. But these three conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
(with others) are in Stoic doctrine varying names or aspects
of the divine unity. Seneca, for instance, had written in the
following tone:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘To whatever country we are banished, two things go with us, our part in
the starry heavens above and the world around, our sole right in the moral
instincts of our own hearts. Such is the gift to us of the supreme power
which shaped the universe. That power we sometimes call “the all-ruling
God,” sometimes “the incorporeal Wisdom” which is the creator of mighty
works, sometimes the “divine spirit” which spreads through things great
and small with duly strung tone, sometimes “destiny” or the changeless
succession of causes linked one to another<a id="FNanchor_2350" href="#Footnote_2350" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.’</p>

</div>

<p>Here the larger variety of terms used by the early Stoic
teachers<a id="FNanchor_2351" href="#Footnote_2351" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> is reduced to four aspects of the first cause, namely
God, the Word, the divine spirit, and destiny. The Christian
writers struck out from the series the fourth member, and the
doctrine of the Trinity was there. Its stiff formulation for
school purposes in the shape ‘these three are one’ has given
it the appearance of a paradox; but to persons conversant with
philosophic terminology such a phrase was almost commonplace,
and is indeed found in various associations<a id="FNanchor_2352" href="#Footnote_2352" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>. The subsequent
conversion of the members of the triad into three ‘persons’
introduced a simplification which is only apparent, for the
doctrine must always remain meaningless except as a typical
solution of the old problem of ‘the One and the many,’ carried up
to the level of ultimate Being<a id="FNanchor_2353" href="#Footnote_2353" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subsequent history.</div>

<p id="section485"><b>485.</b> In the ages that have since followed mythology and
philosophy have been at work side by side within
the Christian church. At no time had Christians
of philosophic temperament entirely thrown off the belief in
marvels, and this in increasing degree infected the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
Hellenistic world from the second century onwards. But this
spirit of concession proved no sure protection to men who, after
all, were guilty of thinking. It was substantially on this ground
that the first persecutions began within the church. Demetrius,
bishop of Alexandria (circ. 230 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), excommunicated Origen,
and obtained the support of the great majority of the Christian
churches for his action; still Origen steadily held his ground,
and has found advocates in all ages of Christian history<a id="FNanchor_2354" href="#Footnote_2354" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.
Throughout the ‘dark ages’ philosophical thought lay almost
extinguished, and a childish credulity attained such monstrous
dimensions as to threaten the very existence of social life. In
the ecclesiastical chronicles of the middle ages miracles are so
frequent that the orderly course of nature seems the exception;
angels and devils are so many that men are almost forgotten.
To these hallucinations and fictions of the monastery, so deservedly
ridiculed in the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i><a id="FNanchor_2355" href="#Footnote_2355" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>, the practical
experience of daily life must always have supplied some
corrective; the swollen claim of ‘faith’ to say yes to every
absurdity had to be met by the reassertion of criticism, the right
to say ‘no.’ The Reformation, at the cost of infinite effort and
sacrifice, swept away the miracles of the saints; modern criticism
has spared none of the marvels of the Old Testament, and is
beginning to lay its axe to the root of those of the New. Every
day the conviction that ‘miracles do not happen’ gains ground
amongst intelligent communities; that is (in philosophic language)
the dualism of God and Nature is being absorbed in the wider
monism according to which God and Nature are one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian philosophy.</div>

<p id="section486"><b>486.</b> As the credit of Christian mythology diminishes, the
philosophic content of the new religion is regaining
its authority. The doctrine of the ‘spiritual life’
has not yet lost its freshness or its power; but the more closely
it is examined, the more clearly will it be seen that it is rooted
in the fundamental Stoic conceptions of providence and duty,
and that, in the history of the Christian church, it is specially
bound up with the life and writings of the apostle Paul. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
not suggested that the sketch of Christian teaching contained in
this chapter is in any way a complete or even a well-proportioned
view of the Christian faith; for we have necessarily thrown into
the background those elements of the new religion which are
drawn from Judaism<a id="FNanchor_2356" href="#Footnote_2356" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> or from the personality of the Founder.
Nor have we found in Paul a Stoic philosopher: it remains for
a more direct and profound study to determine which of the
forces which stirred his complex intellect most exactly represents
his true and final convictions. No man at any rate ever admitted
more frankly the conflict both of moral and of intellectual
cravings within himself; no man ever cautioned his followers
more carefully against accepting all his words as final. With
these reservations we may perhaps venture to join in the hopes
of a recent writer who was endowed with no small prophetic
insight:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The doctrine of Paul will arise out of the tomb where for centuries it has
lain buried. It will edify the church of the future; it will have the consent
of happier generations, the applause of less superstitious ages. All will be
too little to pay the debt which the church of God owes to this “least of the
apostles, who was not fit to be called an apostle, because he persecuted the
church of God<a id="FNanchor_2357" href="#Footnote_2357" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.”’</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Stoicism in the present.</div>

<p id="section487"><b>487.</b> When that day comes, it will be recognised that
Stoicism is something more than what the Church
Fathers meant when they described it as part of
the ‘preparation of the gospel’; that it may rather be regarded
as forming an integral part of the Christian message, or (as
it has been recently called) a ‘root of Christianity<a id="FNanchor_2358" href="#Footnote_2358" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.’ If this
view is correct, Stoicism is not dead nor will it die; whether it
is correct or not, the study of Stoicism is essential to the full
understanding of the Christian religion, as also to that of many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
other fundamental conceptions of our modern life. Still the
Christian churches celebrate yearly in quick succession the twin
festivals of Pentecost and Trinity, in which the groundwork
of the Stoic physics is set forth for acceptance by the faithful in
its Christian garb; whilst the scientific world has lately in hot
haste abandoned the atomic theory as a final explanation of the
universe, and is busy in re-establishing in all its essentials the
Stoic doctrine of an all-pervading aether. In the practical
problems of statesmanship and private life we are at present too
often drifting like a ship without a rudder, guided only by the
mirages of convention, childishly alarmed at the least investigation
of first principles; till the most numerous classes are in
open revolt against a civilisation which makes no appeal to their
reason, and a whole sex is fretting against a subordination which
seems to subserve no clearly defined purpose. In this part of
philosophy we may at least say that Stoicism has stated clearly
the chief problems, and has begun to pave a road towards their
solution. But that solution will not be found in the refinements
of logical discussion: of supreme importance is the force of
character which can at the right moment say ‘yes’ or say ‘no.’
In this sense also (and not by any more mechanical interpretation)
we understand the words of the Founder of Christianity:
‘let your language be “Yes, yes” or “No, no”; anything in
excess of this comes from the Evil one<a id="FNanchor_2359" href="#Footnote_2359" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.’ To the simple and
the straightforward, who trust themselves because they trust a
power higher than themselves, the future belongs.</p>

secondary importance. Translations from the New Testament are, as a rule, taken

keeping in the background the mass of associations which hinder the modern reader
from taking the words of the writers in their simple and natural sense; but on the

as a man (κατὰ σάρκα), yet now we do so no longer’ 2 Cor. v 16. The Pauline
doctrine of the spiritual resurrection, in spite of its place in the sacred canon, has
never been recognised by popular Christianity, but it has found notable defenders in
Origen in ancient times, and in Bishop Westcott recently. ‘No one of [Origen’s]
opinions was more vehemently assailed than his teaching on the Resurrection. Even
his early and later apologists were perplexed in their defence of him. Yet there is no
point on which his insight was more conspicuous. By keeping strictly to the Apostolic
language he anticipated results which we have hardly yet secured. He saw that it is
the “spirit” which moulds the frame through which it is manifested; that the body
is the same, not by any material continuity, but by the permanence of that which
gives the law, the <i>ratio</i> as he calls it, of its constitution (Frag. <i>de res.</i> ii 1, p. 34).
Our opponents say now that this idea is a late refinement of doctrine, forced upon us
by the exigencies of controversy. The answer is that no exigencies of controversy
brought Origen to his conclusion. It was, in his judgment, the clear teaching of
St Paul’ Westcott, <i>Religious Thought in the West</i>, p. 244.</p>

‘anticipation’ of their own, exactly as in modern times the Darwinists, having
borrowed from Epicurus the doctrine of atoms, regard the original doctrine as a
‘marvellous anticipation’ of modern science. Justin Martyr goes further, and concludes

which figures so largely in popular conceptions of Christianity, but is now thought to
be but slightly connected with its characteristic message. On this point see especially

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
